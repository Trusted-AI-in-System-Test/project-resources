the bug**\r\nOur hardware doesn't use the `battery_status` module, rather a power module connected over I2C, so we aren't including `battery_status` in our cmake build file.  I believe that without including `battery_status` in the build, you fail to pick up the parameters in `analog_battery_params_deprecated.c`.  \r\n\r\nI see this PR from sometime ago, which is in the same area: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/13299/commits/c20190640039be4379b9fc2e5a0ec160d5b68699 .  It's using param_find to 'force them into the list' but I don't think this is working.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nPerhaps somewhat unique, but:\r\n1. build a target without the `battery_status` module\r\n2. Connect to QGC and open the Power settings\r\n3. Observe the \"Missing Params:.. BAT_V_DIV .... BAT_A_PER_V\". warning\r\n\r\nIf you have v5x hardware (or ModalAI FCv1), you might be able to replicate pretty easy loading a master branch build and connected to QGC...  I don't think the v5x has `battery_status` either\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo warning in QQC from these legacy params being missing.  I can add them to our target or in the voxlpm driver but seems hacky.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50114502/79283717-7b191d80-7e6d-11ea-9580-b8912cff4056.png)\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- modalai_fc-v1\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSimple work around is for me to add these params to the voxlpm driver, but seems too hacky...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14664","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14664/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14664/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14664/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14664","id":599417613,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDAzMDY0NDU5","number":14664,"title":"fix

the bug**\r\nHi, I found very strange GPS behavior after uploaded \"v1.11.0-beta1\" to pixhawk 4. Firstly, I configured MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2 (My UAV has been flown using this config. before since firmware v1.8.2, v1.9.2 and v1.10.2 and I got no error). Then, I investigated using\"mavlink inspector\" in QGC and take a look at GPS_RAW_INT. \r\n\r\nGPS signal seems unstable, the fluctuation ranges from 0 to 5 Hz. It should be a constant value or nearly constant (compared with an older firmware, I have already tested before).\r\n\r\nFinally, the result is the flight mode could not be changed from ALTITUDE to POSITION, No Green GPS LED light visible. I managed the test as follows \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce / Test Case**\r\nCase 1: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = Disabled\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=9764baca-ec06-40aa-b1ba-79719d0b75fc\r\n\r\nCase 2: v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=a670c429-592e-4e52-a200-b811bd45f14d\r\n\r\nCase 3: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM/SERIAL4 \r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=98b8c1ec-d492-48b5-823a-870af29e5686\r\n\r\nCase 4:  v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning\r\nMAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM2  \r\n\r\nCase 5: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK\r\nMAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM/SERIAL4 \r\n\r\nCase 6: v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM/SERIAL4 \r\nMAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM2  \r\n\r\nCase 7: v1.10.1 --> OK (compare to Case 2 v1.11.0-beta1. It is not the same result even config. is the same)\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=29bea816-da9d-4cd4-b042-c0fdb14e489d\r\n\r\nThe error is the same whether telemetry is available on that port or not, indoor or outdoor if I configure MAV_X_CONFIG to TELEM2. According to the flight log of Case 2, you will see the strange GPS behavior at \"GPS Uncertainty and GPS Noise & Jamming\". In every test case, Telemetry works fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, GPS works fine if I upload the older firmware \"v1.10.1\" (v1.8.2 / v1.9.2 is the same) Is it firmware bug ? or Did I miss anything?\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Describe the type of drone: Tiltrotor using E-flite Convergence airframe\r\n- Hardware: Pixhawk4 + GPS pixhawk 4 + Holybro telemetry\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14659/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14655","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14655/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14655/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14655/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14655","id":599013834,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTkwMTM4MzQ=","number":14655,"title":"NuttX

behavior**\r\nAcc 0 should measure about -9.81m/s/s not +9.81\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=9531c76c-abd9-4656-9fd1-3d50dbc8ced5\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n@bkueng it was ok at 2f3174abb0ee2503a94d8b41b99e729fc1946ebb and not after 532ccd18ad2d82f72a33d1c0915a50b49f53eada\r\n\r\nAnother issue happened when I tried to calibrated the acceleros with this issue: scales of imu 1 and 2 were negative.\r\nShouldn't be great to have test on this","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14611","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14611/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14611/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14611/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14611","id":595930400,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDAwMzE4OTc1","number":14611,"title":"microRTPS:

the bug**\r\nGet trapped in \"dangerously low battery and SHUTDOWN\" status, due to missing usb connected detection in commander battery status check (>= v1.10).\r\n\r\nSome functions has been rewrite in Commander.cpp since last year. Battery status check lines has been gathered into a separate function battery_status_check(). And shutdown_if_allowed() is added to provide some kind of another safeguard. The code looks cleaner now. however, the missing of usb power connected detection leads to trap into \"dangerously low battery and SHUTDOWN\" status in some cases. \r\nThe detection is presented in previous px4 versions, but been dropped since v1.10.\r\n\r\nThis issue majorly infects MindRacer when powered by USB alone, like for calibration or debugging purpose.  In some cases it will also have impact on other FCUs. \r\n\r\nDetails as following:\r\n1. on booting up (powered from USB alone), MindRacer's ADC pin for battery measurement needs few seconds to reach stable. Between this very short period there is a chance the voltage on ADC pin may exceeds battery detection threshold. So even only few seconds, but already been quite enough for battery_check_status() function detects a false emergency low battery and issues shutdown command. The system then will get into ARMING_STATE_SHUTDOWN status and trapped there, even now input on ADC pin has been stable and no battery is detected. \r\n2. This issue might also happen to other FCU in some cases. Considering when a FCU connected with a 3S battery, now connected to ground station through USB cable to do parameter update or calibration. If in groundstation you changes the power parameter from 3S battery to 4S battery, the system will then immediately get into ARMING_STATE_SHUTDOWN status and trapped there, unless you disconnect the battery and reboot. \r\n\r\nWhen powered from battery, MindRacer does not have this issue as PDB will smooth away all voltage fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not observed on firmware version earlier than v1.9.x.\r\nThis issue does not exist on MindPX.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. For MindRacer users, use v1.10 or higher version of firmware.\r\n2. connected MindRacer (standalone) to QGC through USB cable and wait for connection.\r\n3. QGC will alert \"dangerously low battery, system SHUTDOWN\"\r\n4. You can not perform most of calibration/param update actions. QGC alert \"Transition denied, SHUTDOWN to INIT\" or similar.\r\n\r\nThe issue may not show up every time on power up, but the chances are quite high.\r\n\r\nIf you use other FCUs, \r\n1. power FCU with a 3S battery, use v1.10 or higher version of firmware.\r\n2. connect to QGC through USB cable and wait for connection.\r\n3. in QGC change power parameter from 3S battery to 4S battery.\r\n4. QGC will alert \"dangerously low battery, system SHUTDOWN\"\r\n5. You can not perform most of calibration/param update actions. QGC alert \"Transition denied, SHUTDOWN to INIT\" or similar. You need to unplug battery and reboot to get out of this.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNot get into \"dangerously low battery, system SHUTDOWN\" status.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis problem rather annoying when connect to ground station for calibrating/debugging.\r\nI suggest 2 feasible fixes to this issue.\r\n1. Add system_power.usb_connected detection in battery_status_check() function to avoid getting into shutdown status when usb cable connected.\r\n2. Strictly the implementation of shutdown_if_allowed() is problematic. Once you get into ARMING_STATE_SHUTDOWN status you can never get out. So It is recommended to use a test-before-set 2 phase pattern instead, query if transition allowed first, so we can always rollback to a safe status if something happened in middle of transition.\r\n\r\nMethod 1 is quite straight forward and I have tested working fine on my side. Method 2 may be further improved in later releases.\r\n\r\n@LorenzMeier @dagar Can you please help to fix this in the coming release?\r\nthank you.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14566/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14566/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14565","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14565/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14565/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14565/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14565","id":592100216,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzk3MTQ2NTcw","number":14565,"title":"boards: mro_ctrl-zero-f7 fix i2c","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-04-01T17:58:56Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T18:27:36Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T18:27:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/14565","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14565","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14565.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14565.patch","merged_at":"2020-04-01T18:27:35Z"},"body":" -

the bug**\r\nThe arming state machine \r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/73f7243bc8350664864685d1a0adbeaaa2f2c5e5/src/modules/commander/state_machine_helper.cpp#L59-L73\r\nis working and unit tested but in some use cases the state machine can get called with illegal transitions and the user is presented with an unexpected message saying \"Transition denied:\" from\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/73f7243bc8350664864685d1a0adbeaaa2f2c5e5/src/modules/commander/state_machine_helper.cpp#L237\r\n\r\nThis issue tries to track those cases since they seem to unveil common problems.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- `Transition denied: SHUTDOWN to INIT` / `Transition denied: SHUTDOWN to ARMED`\r\n1. Power drone with battery and power module such that it measures a battery voltage and state\r\n2. Plug autopilot to computer via USB\r\n3. Unplug battery\r\n4. The autopilot tries to shutdown but the board doesn't support shutdown (tested on a Pixhawk 4).\r\n5. ![image (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/77922850-e07fe280-72a1-11ea-87d2-eb462f476355.png)\r\n6. The autopilot is in SHUTDOWN state and any attempt to calibrate or arm will trigger one of the messages.\r\n\r\n- `Transition denied: ARMED to INIT`\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/14158 describes this case\r\n1. Arm and start flying the drone\r\n2. Open the Radio tab in QGC\r\n3. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/77923727-1d98a480-72a3-11ea-9883-d65a6d1722e9.png)\r\n\r\n- `Transition denied: ARMED to SHUTDOWN`\r\n(That one I'm not sure if it got solved already.)\r\n1. Use a power supply to bench test your drone or configure the battery to be completely empty before it actually is to avoid damaging any battery\r\n2. Bench test arm and start flying the drone\r\n3. Let the battery deplete completely by lowering the voltage of the supply or getting into a critical battery state through configuration.\r\n4. The drone can attempt to shut down in air\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe guards for the transitions and the messaging that enables debugging should stay as they are since they prevent further safety-critical problems. But the calls to the state machine should be revised such that it's highly unlikely the user is ever bothered with a transition guard message.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14527/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14526","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14526/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14526/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14526/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14526","id":590303570,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTAzMDM1NzA=","number":14526,"title":"I2CSPIDriverBase

the bug**\r\nlsm303d & l3gd20 can not be calibrate leveled in single calibration process.\r\nThis issue should infect all FCUs have these 2 sensors onboard (>= v1.10).\r\nThis issue can only be visible/detected when FCU has only these 2 sensors on-board (or uses these 2 as primary motion sensors? or equivalent to disable other sensor's driver?)\r\nThis issue does not exist in earlier version of version (<=v1.9).\r\nThis issue is not observed with other type of IMU sensors so far.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Use a FCU that has and only has lsm303d & l3gd20 on board. MindPX users is more convenient as just need to disconnect the isolated redundant IMU module. If you are using Pixhawk, you may have to remove other sensors on-board (should be equivalent to disable drivers for other sensors onboard, but I did not test that case). \r\n2. connect to QGC. \r\n3. Clear/reset all parameters to start over.\r\n4. Select a generic airframe, like Generic Quad X.\r\n5. Perform a complete sensor calibration process, util 'level horizon' finished and all indicators becomes green.\r\n6. Place FCU in level, go to fly view and check the flight gadget. The attitude gadget is drifting and not leveled. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n The attitude gadget should be leveled.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe issue can be corrected by a second 'level horizon' action. \r\n1. Following above step 6, do a 'level horizon' action again. \r\n2. reboot the FCU and connect to QGC.\r\n3. The attitude gadget is leveled this time.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14503","id":589276796,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODkyNzY3OTY=","number":14503,"title":"px4_fmu-v3

the bug**\r\nI found on a flight that I have came to nearly empty battery that there is something that look to me like bug in the emergency and critical battery logic.\r\nI started to land in nearly empty battery, but then the emergency battery logic intiated, and instead of continue landing, it started to RTL (climbing), I took control to RC and landed.\r\nit seems that COM_LOW_BAT_ACT doesn't respect the current flight mode, and if the drone has already started to land, it can re-initiate action, that might be climbing.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n * in order to reproduce easily in simulator I have changed the next parameters:\r\nBAT_LOW_THR = 30%\r\nBAT_EMERGEN_THR  = 20%\r\nBAT_CRIT_THR = 10%\r\nCOM_LOW_BAT_ACT = 3 (Return mode at critically low level, Land mode at current position if reaching dangerously low levels)\r\nRTL_RETURN_ALT = 100m\r\nSIM_BAT_MIN_PCT = 0%\r\n\r\n * take-off\r\n * fly to another location\r\n * climb to 20m\r\n * wait that the battery will get to ~30% and start land\r\n * the RTL will be initiated, starting with climbing (and here the bug)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nin case of already started landing, don't initiate RTL. and don't re-initiate landing\r\n\r\n**Log Files and

These FCUs may not able to perform mag calibration in QGC.\r\n\r\nSome revisions of MindPX hardware has on board mpu6500 sensor so these FCUs will be infected. MindRacer is lucky to be immune to this defect as the onboard 6500 driver is launched in last place which goes beyond the uORB counted sensor number.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Use a MindPX FCU, or any other FCUs that uses 6500 sensor, just make sure 6500 driver is not the last one launched.\r\n2. connect to QGC and start a mag calibration.\r\n3. The calibration will fail.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nmag calibration should complete without issue.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n````\r\nWARN  [commander] Mag #1 (ID 263202) no matching uORB devid\r\nWARN  [commander] [cal] calibration failed: mag\r\n````\r\n\r\n**Pull request**\r\nPull request  #14441  is to fix this issue.

The issue is pure in this line (generating the launch file) : \r\n\r\n```\r\n<arg name=\"cmd\" value=\"xmlstarlet ed -d '//plugin[@name=&quot;mavlink_interface&quot;]/14562' -s '//plugin[@name=&quot;mavlink_interface&quot;]' -t elem -n 14562 -v 14562 $(find smartuav)/models/iris_depth_camera_lidar/iris_depth_camera_lidar.sdf\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried switching the port numbers from udp to tcp but to no avail.

have a look at the simple mission shown in the picture below.\r\nThe mission consists of the following items:\r\n1) Vtol takeoff\r\n2) Waypoint\r\n3) Transition to Hover\r\n4) Land\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that the vehicle finishes the transition to hover just when it reaches the transition waypoint (3) which shares the position of the previous waypoint(2). (QGC ties the transition waypoint and the previous waypoint together to make this clear).\r\nThe acceptance radius of the transition waypoint is calculated dynamically, taking into account a target deceleration parameter (VT_B_DEC_MSS) and the ground speed of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n**However**, what I'm seeing is the following: Somehow the calculation of the backtransition acceptance radius is not executed anymore, the prinft in the relevant section does not appear in the console.\r\nI also don't understand anymore how this should have ever worked. The acceptance radius of the backtransition item (3) should be associated to the previous waypoint (2), as it represents the position of the backtransition item. Looking at the code I don't really see where this is happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7610489/77059784-8dc44200-69e8-11ea-862f-43b7a9e3023c.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14423","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14423/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14423/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14423/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14423","id":584193295,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzkwODIyNzMx","number":14423,"title":" fix IntrusiveQueue::remove: several bugs that led to improper state of the queue","user":{"login":"bkueng","id":281593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/281593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng","html_url":"https://github.com/bkueng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-03-19T06:31:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T16:02:16Z","closed_at":"2020-03-21T16:00:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/14423","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14423","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14423.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14423.patch","merged_at":"2020-03-21T16:00:10Z"},"body":"@limhyon noticed that tfmini was not working anymore on master, and traced it down to https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/004d916095321c01c08719e12ca971d1e45a5453/src/drivers/distance_sensor/tfmini/TFMINI.cpp#L248 \r\nThe driver was suddenly not scheduled anymore, and removing the line 'fixed' it.\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem is however an incorrect implementation of `IntrusiveQueue::remove`, and it got revealed with https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/14331.\r\n\r\nAlso, tfmini was scheduled at 10kHz which seems excessive given the sensor outputs data at 100Hz.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\n@jkflying reported an effect I've seen before:\r\nDuring a normal landing procedure the thrust gets first cut by the reaction to ground detected and then cut by the takeoff logic because the vehicle is back ready for another takeoff.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/76170595-a4b29b00-6183-11ea-9898-7876a6628941.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the thrust and attitude limit while landing is in the loop order after the position controller ran and directly operates on the attitude setpoint skipping the position controllers minimum thrust limit. The takeoff thrust limitation on the other had is before the position controller and amends the input to it.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nI'm unifying the thrust and attitude limit logic to be in one place where it already was for the takeoff. Both logics for takeoff and landing do these things in common:\r\n- cut thrust\r\n- set roll pitch level\r\n- set yawspeed to zero and yaw setpoint to current yaw\r\n- reset position control integral\r\n\r\nI still have to check if reactivating flight task and reseting the hover thrust is also desired otherwise they can be conditional for just the takeoff.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nIt's not 100% clear to me if `MPC_THR_MIN` should be the minimum thrust at all times even during landing and takeoff or if the takeoff ramp should always start at zero thrust and thrust should go down to zero after landing.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nQuick SITL test, needs more testing and review.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14326/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14326/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14325","id":577559370,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1Nzc1NTkzNzA=","number":14325,"title":"NXP
