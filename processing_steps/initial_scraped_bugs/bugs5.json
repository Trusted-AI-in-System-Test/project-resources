configuring the Pixhawk to use the Iridium module, the Pixhawk refuses to boot if the Iridium module is disconnected. When connected to power over USB, the Cube plays and “Error tune”, indicating a hard fault in the system. See the [PX4 sounds](https://docs.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/getting_started/tunes.html).\r\n\r\n**Hardware**\r\n\r\nThe error was introduced on a Pixhawk Cube Orange, running PX4 v1.11.2, and an Iridium RockBLOCK 9603 module. I have checked, and the problem persists in PX4 v1.12.0-beta6 too, see below.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the error**\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the cube is running PX4 v1.11.2, and that a SD card is installed.\r\n2. Power on the Cube using USB\r\n3. Set “ISBD_CONFIG = GPS 2” without connecting the Iridium Module.\r\n4. Reboot the pixhawk\r\n5. It should not refuse to connect to QGC, and will play the “Error Tune“.\r\n6. There should now be a .log file on the SD card which displays a message similar to:[hardfault_log] -- 2000-01-01-00:00:06 Begin Fault Log --System fault Occurred on: 2000-01-01-00:00:06Type:Hard Fault in file:armv7-m/up_hardfault.c at line: 148 running task: iridiumsbd\r\n\r\n**Removing the error after introducing it**\r\n\r\n1. Disconnect the USB\r\n2. Connect the Iridium module to serial port “GPS 2”\r\n3. It now boots as normal, with the iridium connected.\r\n4. Change “ISBD_CONFIG = disabled”, disconnect iridium, and reboot the vehicle.\r\n5. It now boots as normal, without the iridium connected.\r\n\r\n**PX4 Version**\r\nInitially, this error was found on v1.11.2. I tested with the most recent beta of v1.12, v1.12.0-beta6, and the problem still persists. However, the pixhawk does not play an error tune on boot, but reboots automatically continuously and refuses to connect to QGC, but this is the only thing that seems to be different from v1.11.2. Otherwise, the same steps for reproducing the error and removing the error works for v1.12.0-beta6.\r\n\r\n**Previous issues**\r\nI found [this](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10092) issue, which seemed like it could be relevant. However, it was closed and marked as fixed. Not sure if this is a new issue or connected to the previous issue, as I have not had time to debug this any further yet.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17831/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17809","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17809/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17809/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17809/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17809","id":930982537,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njc4NTU0Mjkw","number":17809,"title":"platforms/nuttx: px4_init initialize and reset all I2C buses","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":10884840,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDg0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/enhancement%20(improvement)%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"enhancement (improvement) 💡","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-06-27T17:36:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T13:54:51Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T13:54:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/17809","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17809","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17809.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17809.patch","merged_at":"2021-08-17T13:54:51Z"},"body":"This adds a full I2C bus reset in board init, both using the low level I2C driver reset (if enabled), followed by a general call software reset.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nBrings a major list of improvements. Listed bellow.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\n\r\nMajor changes/features:\r\n* **Communications and data exchange in the localhost network only** are now possible with ROS2 Foxy when `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY` env variable is set to 1. This will also by default enable the **Shared Memory Transport** feature, which is also the default in ROS2. Known limitation: This will not work with ROS2 Galactic though when the middleware is set to CycloneDDS, so this was limited to when the `rmw` implementation is set to FastRTPS, or unset but defaulted to FastRTPS (which is the case of Foxy);\r\n* The microRTPS client (FMU side) now has **statistics** of the link TX/RX when using `micrortps_client status` and provides also a max bandwidth usage of the link using the `-m` argument;\r\n* Fixes the fact that the `micrortps_agent` would SEGFAULT with memory corruption. This was being caused because the program was attempting to delete the `Timesync` object instance twice. This is now solved and the agent exits correctly;\r\n* There's no need now to create specific `rtps` models (like `iris_rtps`), as now, by default, the `micrortps_client` will be started in `rcS` when one builds the PX4 SITL target using the `make px4_sitl_rtps`. This will require an update on the docs, as the `iris_rtps` was removed from the `make` target options.\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n* Apply on the microRTPS agent Pubs and Subs the default QoS policies for memory management and publish mode found in ROS pubs/subs.\r\n* Increase the stack size on the microRTPS client to avoid warnings regarding low stack;\r\n* Add fix to `PRIu32` and `PRIu16` macros usage in the microRTPS agent when building the transport code;\r\n* Building now the microRTPS agent in CI to avoid changes that break it here and on the `px4_ros_com` side. This also adds the `BUILD_MICRORTPS_AGENT` option to `make` to allow building the microRTPS agent during the PX4 `_rtps` build (e.g. `make BUILD_MICRORTPS_AGENT=1 px4_sitl_rtps`);\r\n* Others.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nNone that I can think of but open to suggestions.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nIn PX4 SITL and with a Pixhawk 4.

In our case, the estimate was sometimes wrong, so that we had to abort flights to avoid stalling or worse.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is especially relevant for UAVCAN-based sensors. We also get 2 warnings shortly after each other directly after boot, showing the airspeed selector started before the sensor was available:\r\n\r\n    [airspeed_selector] Airspeed: switched from sensor (...) to -1\r\n    [airspeed_selector] Airspeed: switched from sensor -1 to 1\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Use the settings ASPD_SCALE_EST = 0 and ASPD_SCALE = 1\r\n2. Connect an airspeed sensor after boot, e.g. by plugging it in on the UAVCAN network\r\n3. Fly in forward flight\r\n4. Update any parameter\r\n4. Observe that in the logged messages wind_estimate.tas_scale (of the relevant airspeed selector wind estimator) is not 1 but is estimated in-flight, until any parameter was updated.\r\n\r\nNote: this behaviour was observed with v1.11.3, but I have no reason to think this behaviour has changed since then.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nwind_estimate.tas_scale should be equal to ASPD_SCALE  when ASPD_SCALE_EST is 0.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below shows the TAS scale from the relevant wind estimator. In-flight, we switched back to hover and adjusted a parameter before continuing. After that, the scale was correct.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57276/121671702-2f80f480-caaf-11eb-9ca2-1e93fa1235e5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Drone:**\r\nAtmos Marlyn: tailsitter VTOL\r\n\r\n**Possible fix**\r\nWe're happy to make a pull request with the fix that works for us: In `AirspeedModule::update_params()`, loop over all validator instances (`MAX_NUM_AIRSPEED_SENSORS`), instead of only the ones for which there currently is an airspeed sensor (`_number_of_airspeed_sensors`).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `AirspeedModule::update_params()` could be called when an airspeed sensor is added. Personally I think it is better to initialize all the airspeed validators as soon as they exist, as that is more robust.\r\n\r\nWe also increased the initial timeout before the airspeed validator starts working, to avoid the warning messages right after boot. For our airspeed sensor it takes 4.5s to become available. If anyone can think of a more generic solution, we're happy to contribute to that as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17754/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17750","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17750/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17750/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17750/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17750","id":918041381,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjY3NTE2OTI1","number":17750,"title":"[UAVCANv1]

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nNow that FlightTask is in the flight mode manager module and that the MC position controller runs on local_position updates, the multicopter position controller also runs when a VTOL plane is in fixedwing mode (using 0 velocity as a reference because trajectory_setpoint is all NAN).\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nAdding a clear control mode flag to tell when the multicopter position controller should run or not.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nUpdating based on the `trajectory_setpoint` update was an option but it would slow down the loop if the estimate comes faster than the setpoint. Also, since \"flight mode manager\" will soon be used for all kind of vehicles (fixedwings, rovers, ...) the `trajectory_setpoint` might also be filled with valid values when the multicopter position

a bug introduced with https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16691. (@dagar @sfuhrer @RomanBapst )\r\n\r\n**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nEli Vigdorchik ran into an undesired external quadchute during one of his test flights as reported on slack (https://px4.slack.com/archives/C39C4E709/p1622652580039900). Log here: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=26c65922-793b-4bad-88fa-86f58b97eb82 . For some reason Param2 of the command is set to 3, triggering the Quadchute instead of doing a normal back transition during RTL. I was able to reproduce in SITL on v1.12.0-beta and on master. I guess the issue is a badly initialized / old value of param2 floating around somewhere.\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=efaae0f0-a8a8-494c-b32d-6e041689836f\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e177614d-a4c1-4ebf-97ca-6ed6fb8cf420\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nExplicitly set Param2 to 0.0f in all occurrences where a normal BT is desired (I searched for all occurrences of *DO_VTOL_TRANSITION in the code).\r\n\r\nI also added a check on NANs. If param2 is a NAN, then _immediate_transition is false too.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nSame procedure, i.e. Position mode flight with RTL triggered over QGC:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7cc61dad-7145-4e81-9ee3-f7c84dd04ef9\r\n\r\nI also tried manual transitions, transitions over QGC, missions with VTOL Land and normal Land items, `commander transition` and switching to Land mode via QGC. I couldn't provoke any external quadchutes.

The direction is circuitous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first log, it was clear there was some mag interference (this was seen on the ground prior to takeoff - approximately 10 degrees could not be corrected even after multiple calibrations) but the issue was that the trajectory from one waypoint to the next does not make sense (in parts of the flight). Instead of going from one point to the next, there are large turns between them.\r\n\r\nI questioned if this was due to an insufficient SD card speed for reading the mission. Testing the SD card speed in QGC gave an average speed of 63kb/s (much too slow but this was only changed after these flights) and there are logging dropouts at some of the points in the log. Right around 22 min where the location looks to be sideways, it was not. In the telemetry replay it does a coordinated turn. This turn at least makes sense, that is the direction is was supposed to go. That changes though later in the same flight.\r\n\r\nAt 22:46 it looks like the aircraft starts to circle down. Maybe to hit the altitude set-point but that does not make too much sense seems it looks like it doesnt actually miss it. After it does circle down though it then just decides to go left (no errors still) and then circle around again. Mag issue? There is no reason for a turn to be in that direction though. The question becomes is if this is mag related and or SD card read access speed and mission related.\r\n\r\nLog 1 - \r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=72ac3453-0872-447d-8716-3fcca37c1e9e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe below log had a new mag installed and there weren't any offsets observed or mag ratios, etc but at 13:17 instead of turning left, the aircraft made a roll to the right before banking to the left to turn. Additionally, it went directly through the waypoint before turning instead of starting at the L1 distance and making the typical rounded turn. From 13:18-13:25 the log looks like the aircraft is going to the wrong direction but there is also a log dropout there, in the telemetry log the orientation and direction looks correct in terms of how the aircraft flew but not why it still turned so late and went right then left. \r\n\r\n\r\nLog 2-\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=1e2b37e4-b557-45d3-9f73-6fb099bf0fa4","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17633","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17633/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17633/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17633/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17633","id":899096182,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjUwODQ2NzUw","number":17633,"title":"mpu9250: tolerate missing/mismatching FIFO samples if I2C slave mag active","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1442874742,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQyODc0NzQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Drivers%20%F0%9F%94%A7","name":"Drivers 🔧","color":"5d3ebc","default":false,"description":"Sensors, Actuators, etc"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2021-05-23T19:57:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T15:22:15Z","closed_at":"2021-05-24T15:22:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/17633","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17633","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17633.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17633.patch","merged_at":"2021-05-24T15:22:14Z"},"body":"When the mpu9250 mag is active it disrupts IMU sampling.

If that is not the same as the setpoint (FW_AIRSPD_TRIM), it will result in an increased energy demand (and that in turn in an increased throttle).\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nLet TECS know the value of FW_AIRSPD_TRIM, and use that as airspeed state in airspeed less case, such that no airspeed error exists. \r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nFlight tested on several VTOLs by disabling

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nIn the default position mode implementation a combination of the default implementation for taking over smoothly:\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12389/files#diff-3372da232c5d9e1ac174e51bdbbe4d31d63547ce2459b5bbb83e15ea6e54d63eR37\r\nand the recent improvements to take over smoothly from

setpoint as if the vehicle was flying because the reset considered its own setpoint from the last loop iteration for taking over smoothly.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThe main fix for this is the one line change 9e8d592\r\nIt by default reactivates tasks on ground with the empty setpoint such that they properly reset and don't try to take over smoothly from their own setpoints generated in the last loop iteration.\r\n\r\nOn the way I also found minor other things to correct:\r\n- In the acceleration stick mapping for legacy reasons the pure jerk limit is called feasability limit: f97fdb4\r\n- In the acceleration stick mapping the acceleration setpoint components taken over from the last task are screwed y = x: \r\n960c0a8\r\n- Minor order cleanup and checking explicitly all components for NAN in FlightTaskManualAcceleration: 446539c\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nI could do a custom implementation for that tasks `reActivate()` but I don't see in what case it could make sense to reactivate a task with it's own setpoints from the last loop iteration.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI tested in SITL and the undesired rampup is gone. The velocity can only be increased by stick after the takeoff ramp was initiated which usually leads to feasible/trackable setpoints.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nBefore. Disarmed the entire time, velocity ramps unexpectedly with stick deflection:\r\n![image-20210421-111902](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/115563524-ee8f0f80-a2b7-11eb-8bf8-5e56ace02e06.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/115563181-8dffd280-a2b7-11eb-826e-f0aaf6f6d737.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17427","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17427/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17427/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17427/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17427","id":862622747,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjE5MTYyOTA0","number":17427,"title":"Fix

As a result we have to be a bit more careful when switching between sensors or in cases where the gyro scale factor changes (eg icm42688p 20 bit data).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17401","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17401/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17401/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17401/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17401","id":858379485,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjE1NjQyNDM1","number":17401,"title":"rc: dsm allow full range","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":10884840,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDg0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/enhancement%20(improvement)%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"enhancement (improvement) 💡","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/33/labels","id":5195527,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTE5NTUyNw==","number":33,"title":"Release v1.12.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":19,"closed_issues":94,"state":"open","created_at":"2020-03-12T16:04:13Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T13:40:28Z","due_on":"2020-09-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2021-04-15T01:12:21Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T16:36:17Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T16:27:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/17401","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17401","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17401.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17401.patch","merged_at":"2021-04-15T16:27:34Z"},"body":"The range was artificially limited as an additional precaution after we reverted the more robust system byte based parsing.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n -

It works fine with firmware version v1.11.3 both lidar and stereo camera. However, after I  upgraded the firmware to v1.12.0-beta1 ( tried master too on 26/03/2021). Even I did not touch any parameters relate to collision prevention, it does not work as expected. The vehicle did not stop and continue going forward when the pilot moves the pitch stick input forward in Position mode.\r\n\r\nNormally, after arming the vehicle, the uorb message \"obstacle_distance_fused\" is shown (test using listener) but with firmware v1.12.0-beta1 it shows \"never publish\". I don't know why the Collision prevention not running even distance_sensor message exists.  PX4 avoidance with D435i sometimes got the error message \"TF Buffer: could not retrieve requested transform from buffer, unregistered\" and the process not continue (I plan to post this error in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance separate to this issue)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. install LW20/C set -R 0 (forward) and D435i running with px4 avoidance in companion computer, set CP_DIST = 5 m.\r\n2. takeoff in position mode\r\n3. move pitch stick input forward to the obstacle\r\n4. See an error, the vehicle does not stop at 5 m and continue moving forward to the obstacle\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nthe vehicle stop at 5 m even pilot moves pitch stick input forward in position mode to the obstacle\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Quadrotor\r\n- Pixhawk 4 (also tried the cube orange)\r\n- lidar lightware LW20/C (I tried ll40ls i2c also, the result is the same)\r\n- Stereo camera D435i with companion computer\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI have tried it in gazebo simulation with h480 airframe.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\n3 Bugs:\r\n1. In position mode when landing, moving the right stick during ground contact and taking off again in exactly the right timing it's possible to get invalid setpoints.\r\n2. Every mode switch results in the task doing EKF reset handling.\r\n3. The initialization of the acceleration stick mapping sets the wrong state.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\n1.  When unlocking the position the velocity setpoint feedback is now considered since https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16791. During ground contact the executed setpoint is NAN even though the task commanded a velocity. This is now handled gracefully by not considering the feedback if it's NAN.\r\n2. This is occuring because of an idea to be able to reinitialize any task on mode change e.g. to allow reinitialization of internal states when switching from Hold mode to Land mode which are currently all still handled by FlightTaskAuto and don't require a task switch.\r\n\r\n   But I found out it leads to issues because the last setpoint and the ekf reset counter state from the previous task are lost and as a result the setpoint transition cannot be handled consistently anymore.\r\n3. I just set the correct state. The issue was hidden by the previous issue 2. because the unexpected EKF reset handling had a similar effect.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI SITL tested all the cases listed above. See also screenshot below.\r\nFor 1. I intentionally injected NANs and verified it's not possible anymore to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n1.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nThe emergency failsafe that prevents the vehicle from crashing with invalid setpoints or states broke with #16869 when the scheduling of the position control module and the setpoint generation got independent. The failsafe mechanism assumed the setpoint is overwirtten by the possibly infeasible trajectory_setpoint on every loop iteration which is not the case anymore. As a result the failsafe reset its hysteresis based on the failsafe setpoint from the last loop iteration and would therefore toggle again every time there's a new unfeasible trajectory_setpoint.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nKeeping the `failsafe_setpoint` separate solves this issue. Note that these failsafe setpoints do the bare minimum to keep the vehicle safely in the air and do not suffer from sideffects ignoring the EKF reset.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI tested by simply injecting malicious unfeasible setpoints when trying to reproduce an unrelated initialization issue. Before this pr the vehicle would come down like a stone. With this pr it works exactly as expected again. Keeping the vehicle in a sane flight condition such that you can take over again, logging regular messages such that you see what's happening.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17028/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17016","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17016/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17016/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17016/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17016","id":821154515,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MjExNTQ1MTU=","number":17016,"title":"param corner case","user":{"login":"bkueng","id":281593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/281593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng","html_url":"https://github.com/bkueng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-03-03T14:21:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T16:30:44Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T16:30:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"There's a corner case with the new default param storage: if a param is set to the firmware default, and there's a board/frame default, on the next boot the param is set to the board/frame default.

the bug**\r\nWhen using master I observed small but steady and fast **oscillations** already in **hover flight in simulation** from a certain point in time on. I never had the time to follow where exactly this comes from and the sim was still usable for the normal tests I do although the oscillations are annoying and could affect observations in tests. When using master today the **same oscillations became a lot worse** and rendered it unusable so I started investigating.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start `make px4_sitl jmavsim`\r\n2. Wait until the simulated GPS is accepted\r\n3. Command a takeoff\r\n4. See pitch oscillations when looking at either the level hovering vehicle's attitude in the visualization or the attitude indicator of the ground station.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNice smooth normal flight without oscillations.\r\n\r\n**Investigation**\r\n- **Before** https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16188 it's flying **exactly as expected**. Smooth motion, no oscillations.\r\n- After the D-term gyro filter cutoff was reduced it has the small **annoying oscillation**.\r\n- After https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15820 specifically https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/6482120d9a9b144831c81e7d2206b561fe8ad1d3 **SITL jMAVsim is unusable**.\r\n\r\nNow since I didn't do any real-world test flights the question is:\r\n- ~Are there general regressions that are not exclusive to my tests?~\r\n- Are the defaults generally less suited now?\r\n- Are the defaults just less suited for SITL jMAVsim now and retuning it (which I'll
