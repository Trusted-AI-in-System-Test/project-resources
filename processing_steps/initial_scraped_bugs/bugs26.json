am using a PixFalcon in passthrough mode to control the ESCs with the Snapdragon flight.\nThe PixFalcon refuses to talk to the ESCs, which beep every few seconds as a result.\n\nI am seeing this on the current master (af02b860b3cc495f67a879088dca9f8b1edd58f9) with the following procedure:\nFlash the firmware to the PixFalcon\n`make px4fmu-v2_default upload`\nWith the SD card out, connect to the NuttShell. Set a normal airframe and reboot:\n\n```\nparam set SYS_AUTOSTART 10020\nreboot\n```\n\nOnce rebooted, re-connect, press the safety switch and test the PWM:\n\n```\npwm test -c 1 -p 1200\n```\n\nThe motor turns, the ESCs are quiet.\nSet the passthrough airframe and reboot (via the nsh command, **not** power-cycling):\n\n```\nparam set SYS_AUTOSTART 20000\nreboot\n```\n\nRe-connect and test the PWM (safety switch not required)\n\n```\npwm test -c 1 -p 1200\n```\n\nThe motor turns, the ESCs are quiet. If I `reboot`, the PixFalcon's LED will now light up purple instead of blinking blue, but `pwm test` still works.\n\nAs soon as I power-cycle, `pwm test` no longer works (and neither does `snapdragon_rc_pwm`).\nAfter stopping `pwm test` with `Ctrl-C` I get the following message:\n\n```\npwm: PWM_SERVO_SET(0): Invalid argument\n```\n\nI see the same output printed in [`snapdragon_rc_pwm`](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/2f48317a9ea7b05d8c61b3d1c44f8229491350b1/src/drivers/snapdragon_rc_pwm/snapdragon_rc_pwm.cpp#L209), where `ret == -1` and `errno ==

Somehow the save command will get executed first (or too early) on the DSP side, therefore saving the old param instead of the newly set one.\n\nThis has been tested on the Snapdragon and should not touch anything else, so it's good to be merged once the checks pass.\n\n@mcharleb, @jywilson FYI\n\nThis should resolve https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/issues/3120.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4164","id":145921187,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjUyNjU1Njc=","number":4164,"title":"Fix calibration messages in QGC","user":{"login":"julianoes","id":1419688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes","html_url":"https://github.com/julianoes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"julianoes","id":1419688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes","html_url":"https://github.com/julianoes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"julianoes","id":1419688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes","html_url":"https://github.com/julianoes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-04-05T08:01:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T07:37:30Z","closed_at":"2016-04-05T22:36:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/4164","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4164","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4164.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4164.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"This should fix #4158.\n\nOnly tested on Pixhawk connected over USB.

appreciated!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4149","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4149/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4149/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4149/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4149","id":145588782,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNDU1ODg3ODI=","number":4149,"title":"Check

adds a roll trim param to combat roll produced by the inertia of the pusher prop.\nAlso, the scaling was removed for roll and pitch during transition in order to correctly apply these values.\n\nWith this param, and the already existing pitch trim the climbing and rolling during transition can be corrected. The roll trim will have to be set depending on the rotation direction of the pusher / puller. In SITL the following values produce a stable result;\nVT_FW_PITCH_TRIM: -0.25\nVT_FW_ROLL_TRIM: 0.25\n\nThe MC, during transition blending does not have enough authority to correct roll and pitch and the FW is not yet in control to apply these corrections.\n\nSetting the above values fixes https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/4079\nAirframes should independently be analyzed for correct values.\nRoll should be set positive CCW pusher prop and negative with a CW pusher prop\nPitch (in all the logs i have seen) always seems to angle up and therefor needs a negative value\n\nI'm not sure if this is a permanent solution or if we should revisit the control authority of MC/FW during transitions.\n\n@AndreasAntener @tumbili @LorenzMeier

process.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3940","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3940/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3940/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3940/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3940","id":138846529,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMzg4NDY1Mjk=","number":3940,"title":"SENS_FLOW_ROT
