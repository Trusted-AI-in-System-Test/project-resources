guys,\r\n\r\nWe've had a total crash with a Skywalker, Plain Airplane profile. PX4 ver 1.6.5 stable.\r\n\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6daee88d-90d7-4cbe-abb7-440591fef87d\r\n\r\nI think I found the reason but it is very strange and I need conformation. This is due to a BUG if I'm correct so please can you take a look and confirm the reason.\r\n\r\nThe pilot is not novice, it is pretty experienced one in terms of piloting a plane, but somehow sometimes the PX4 is overwhelming for him especially in certain situation and he is doing irrational switching (as many PX4 users might do).\r\n\r\nThis is the case:\r\n\r\nHe flew in Position and went in to Loiter (Pause). Then at some point he wanted to gain altitude while in Pause mode. In the graph it is obvious he started pitching up. But nothing happened as it should be, the plain continued to control the speed and throttle in the Loiter, despite the throttle lever was at 60%.  In the latest implementation the Pause button will get the plane in Loiter from any mode. So initially he was in Position mode with activated Position switch. Absolutely normal operation as it is meant to be. Then strangely enough he switched to Manual in the attempt to gain altitude, without turning off the Pause button. The plane continued to circle, but strangely enough transferred the full control of the Throttle to the lever of the RC instead of controlling the throttle in the loiter itself automatically. At the same time the pilot continued to pitch up and gained altitude and I see it clearly in the graphics.. Because he had the lever at 60% throttle it was not enough to sustain the loiter, so the plane started stalling, but still trying to continue to sustain the loiter radius and gain altitude in the condition of under throttle. Because of the stalls the plane was rather going in spirals toward the pilot, and he explained that he thought it is drifting still not realizing what is going on. He did not realize that the Throttle is in his control. Then at the last stall the plane just plunged in nose dive. Because we have a hard limit of 45deg for the pitch, the plane did not have any altitude and time to recover. \r\n\r\nI did not see any mechanical failure, neither to the servos neither to the GPS nor the airspeed sensor nor anything else.\r\n\r\nPlease can you confirm this and if it is a BUG it should be corrected. \r\n\r\nPause should be totally Auto mode, probably allowed to have some small amount of pitch control in order to gain or loose altitude, but in no case we have to give the throttle a manual control at this moment.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8374","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8374/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8374/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8374/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8374","id":276884326,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTU0NzE0MDYy","number":8374,"title":"Fix

preflight checking of ekf2 health status as currently implemented in the commander has a two main vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\nIf GPS arming checks had been disabled via the COM_ARM_WO_GPS parameter, then this was also bypassing the ekf2 health checks.\r\nThe ekf2Check() function in the commander is only called once per mode change or arming request which means that the status is a snapshot of the EKF

local position validity reporting\r\n- Add checking of yaw using a decaying envelope filter to the horizontal checks.\r\n- Publish the check result to estimator_status topic.\r\n\r\nLog from testing of preflight checks here: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=1bc435b7-86e3-4c73-82a5-a98c77949a3d. A magnet was used to cause large changes in magnetic yaw and fail preflight checks whilst attempting to arm.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-27 at 1 29 43 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3596952/33248223-073adfea-d378-11e7-85c6-472212894ea8.png)\r\n\r\nIf a RW vehicle takeoff off with a large yaw error, the EKF will start to reject the GPS data due to the inconsistency with the  INS solution. This combined with the position controller can cause an uncontrolled high speed flight condition. When this occurs, the EKF reports the navigation output as invalid, however after reset back to GPS, the navigation solution will be reported as valid again for a varying interval. This causes an interaction with the commander failsafe resulting in unpredictable transitions in and out of the failsafe mode. The solution implemented by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/39134325740a193fd755763e52faffe030073e5f\r\n\r\n- Checks for loss of navigation for up to 30 seconds after takeoff or until  a horizontal speed of 5 m/s has been achieved.\r\n- If the vehicle is not landed and the check is active, then the navigation is declared as failed if the velocity innovations fail for a continuous period of 1 second.\r\n- This will cause the local and global position and velocity validity to be latched false to prevent unsafe use of position control modes.\r\n- An emergency message 'CRITICAL NAVIGATION FAILURE - CHECK SENSOR CALIBRATION' is output to console and mavlink if the failsafe is activated.\r\n\r\nTest log generated using SITL with  90 degree misaligned compass data here:

not sure if this could be an issue report, but I will post the problem here as I could not find any info on PX4Disscuss, or on other github repositories.\r\n\r\nI am now working on flying 3DR Solo indoor with VICON for research.\r\nAs I googled and came to a conclusion that PX4 is the solution to incorporate VICON data using MavRos, and not Ardupilot (I hope this is true).  \r\nSo I flashed PX4 with `make px4fmu-v3_default`, as lpe version could not be found for v3 (Pixhawk2). \r\n\r\nThe problem I got was not with mocap, but with magnetometer. \r\nEven If I calibrate, I always get `PREFLIGHT FAIL: MAG SENSORS INCONSISTENT` on qgroundcontrol.\r\nAccording to [PX4 Tutorial](https://dev.px4.io/en/tutorials/pre_flight_checks.html), sensors inconsistent means it needs to calibrate, but I tried few times.\r\nI am suspecting the orientation setting. As I searched on the web, Solo has HMC 5983, LSM303D onboard, and HMC 5983 for external magnetometer, and the orientation of onboard sensors is `pitch 180` and that of external is `Yaw293Pitch68Roll90`, however `Yaw293Pitch68Roll90` is not on the list in qgroundcontrol (please see an image below). \r\nAs `Yaw293Pitch68Roll90` was prepared in `src/lib/conversion/rotation.cpp`, I thought by setting `CAL_MAG0_ROT` to 30 would work, but not successful. \r\nI am also wondering why qgc is telling me that there are 4 magnetomers, external: 0 & 1, internal 2, 3 (please see an image below) \r\nI am assuming that the orientation setting of external mag is wrong, so that is why qgc is giving me that error. \r\nAnother reason might be the calibrated radio. I am using 3DR Solo's controller but calibration cannot be completed with this controller.\r\n\r\nI also tried to flash the firmware via USB cable, but I got same result.\r\nIs there any ways to fix this error or disabling external mag? I can use the orientation data from VICON so  magnetometer is not really needed in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThe only person who successfully flashing px4 on Solo that I could find was @lovettchris . \r\nI hope I'm not ruining this repository.... Please tell me if I am. \r\nI am very new to pixhawk, px4, mavros and etc., but I am doing my best to fly my drone! \r\nIt would be a great help If you could help me with this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11141442/32945801-2dbc5a10-cbd8-11e7-839a-29d37bb2413f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11141442/32945794-2a0f48b4-cbd8-11e7-8044-d50a92492c71.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, this may be off topic, but could someone check if my procedure for flying px4 indoor is right? \r\nOn PX4:\r\n - use_tf =true (in the px4_config.yaml file)\r\n - SYSTEM_COMPANIN to 921600 \r\n - ATT_EXT_HDG_M = 2 (motion capture)\r\n - LPE_FUSION = 12\r\n\r\nOn Offboard PC (Ubutu 14.04 LTS):\r\n1. Run `roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=udp://0.0.0.0:14550@10.1.1.10:14555`\r\n2. Run the similar [example](https://dev.px4.io/en/ros/mavros_offboard.html) written in the tutorial,\r\nbut also including\r\n- publisher that publishes VICON data to the topic /mavros/mocap/pose or to /mavros/vision_pose/pose\r\n2.2 \r\n - sending `setpoint_position` to activate

I messed up the branches such that I wasn't able to reopen...\r\n\r\nI discussed with @Stifael and this exact fix here was already planned because the smooth takeoff should be independent of the slewrate.\r\n\r\nFor clarification:\r\n- The slewrate is designed to smooth out manual flight in a \"feed-forward fashion\". It was never meant to support auto flight or offboard flight smoothing. In fact it only produced either slugish perfomance or overshoot problems (like the one described here: #8240 ). It works pretty well ofr manual flight right now but maybe needs to be revised for that as well in the future.\r\n- For auto and offborad smoothing it is important to enable trajectory flying which can be a smooth or an agressive trajectory but the controller should not just ramp it's setpoint around regardless of the actual error.\r\n- The smooth takeoff should be independent of and not affected by the slewrate. Otherwise it doesn't work correctly. It's goal is too basically ramp the multicopters total thrust (and hence motor speeds) to the thrust wich is necessary to achieve the current velocity setpoint in z direction just at the beginning of a flight. It's designed to be always enabled to allow for a nicer start in terms of power, sound and looks for any altitude controlled mode just after switching out of the idle motor speeds.\r\n\r\nFYI @korigod

Report**\r\n\r\nI file this as a bug report since I'm concerned that my crash today may have other reasons than accidentally flipping the Kill Switch. \r\n\r\nI was performing some tests to eliminate a strong Oszillation when braking in PosCTL. This was improving, when I wanted to do another Test, shortly after Taking of the Rotors stopped in Mid-Air and the Vehicle crashed on the road where Motors where spinning again. While hitting the Ground the Battery got disconnected (as can be seen in the Telemetry log). \r\n\r\nSadly the ULG stops shortly after start so about 2meters of flight are missing from the Vehicles Log (this is kind of strange). Also the OSD did not record anything since it claimed that there was no Communication (this may also be a bug of the OSD FW but it said that there was no data for more than 400 secs, which usually does not happen). \r\n\r\nSo I'm stuck with the Telemetry Log. This is the last I got over Telemetry (from the Log):\r\n\r\n![killswitch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6877067/32623752-760951f8-c587-11e7-8ec7-9ea27c5a3fcf.jpg)\r\n\r\nHere comes the 2nd strange Part. The Kill-Switch was engaged and disengaged under **0.5 sec and this twice in sequence**. I checked with my Remote and it is almost impossible to really push the switch to the position in-between where it may flip back in this quick manner. I'm not aware that I flipped the Switch and the Telemetry RC Input (Channel 6) does not reflect any change in Signal. I performed many flights, and never flipped the switch unintentionally.\r\n\r\nTelemetry Log (Check last 15 secs) : [2017-11-09 18-05-27.tlog.zip](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1458838/2017-11-09.18-05-27.tlog.zip)\r\n\r\nULog Upload : https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=1452c840-3003-4913-b528-1fff3f17d447","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8262","id":272613520,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzI2MTM1MjA=","number":8262,"title":"Protocol splitter is not sending any messages on UART","user":{"login":"avinash-palleti","id":362099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjA5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/362099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti","html_url":"https://github.com/avinash-palleti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinash-palleti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-11-09T15:52:02Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T08:03:44Z","closed_at":"2017-11-27T08:03:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Few changes are required to compile and enable protocol_splitter which are done in below branch,\r\nhttps://github.com/avinash-palleti/Firmware/tree/rtps\r\n\r\nWith above changes it is expected that protocol_splitter has to send both mavlink and RTPS on UART.

The bug is critical for offboard mode usage.\r\n\r\nFlying in offboard mode we had constantly observed position setpoint overshoots in case of flight to distant setpoint. E.g., here we are flying back and forth in offboard mode: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=61a675f6-020a-462f-b1cf-b58974460d44. Overshoots really stand out:\r\n\r\n![Overshoots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32437968-ff23a816-c2f9-11e7-8745-67fef6ea073d.png)\r\n\r\nHere is plot of y, vy and corresponding setpoints for 1000 m flight in offboard in SITL on current master (https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=92b7ba3c-e2f7-4094-98a3-05e8b5a8493f):\r\n\r\n![master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32437865-b5007b24-c2f9-11e7-9580-2f456f57f81b.png)\r\n\r\nAs can be seen on the plot, copter have overshooted setpoint for over 60 m because velocity setpoint started to drop from max forward velocity when copter already was 50 m ahead of setpoint.\r\n\r\nAfter debugging of mc_pos_control_main.cpp it became clear that cause of overshoots is windup of `_vel_sp_prev(0)` and `(1)`. The reason is [this fragment](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/aa699cf4b7e63d9bf17dc2ba2b95e2e02224a6ab/src/modules/mc_pos_control/mc_pos_control_main.cpp#L2455) of `calculate_velocity_setpoint()`: \r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (!_control_mode.flag_control_auto_enabled) {\r\n\tvel_sp_slewrate(dt);\r\n}\r\n\r\n_vel_sp_prev = _vel_sp;\r\n\r\n/* ... */\r\n\r\n/* make sure velocity setpoint is constrained in all directions (xyz) */\r\nfloat vel_norm_xy = sqrtf(_vel_sp(0) * _vel_sp(0) + _vel_sp(1) * _vel_sp(1));\r\n\r\nif (vel_norm_xy > _vel_max_xy) {\r\n\t_vel_sp(0) = _vel_sp(0) * _vel_max_xy / vel_norm_xy;\r\n\t_vel_sp(1) = _vel_sp(1) * _vel_max_xy / vel_norm_xy;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo `vel_sp_slewrate()` never see constrained velocity and `_vel_sp_prev` continues to rise to hunders and thousands m/s. When copter approaches the setpoint, `_vel_sp_prev` drops, but it's change rate is limited by `vel_sp_slewrate()`. Because of this windup `_vel_sp` can't begin to lower at time and vehicle overshoots. Overshoots are negligible in AUTO mode because mc_pos_control moves position setpoint so it is always close to the vehicle.\r\n\r\nIt would be more correct to address this moving `_vel_sp_prev = _vel_sp` to the end of control cycle, but this change causes incorrect behavior of smooth takeoff limiter so I had to move velocity constraining before `_vel_sp_prev` assignment, leaving smooth takeoff limit after it.\r\n\r\nThis is the same 1000 m flight in SITL after fix (https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d5bd2519-432c-446a-b8c9-fd021c2fdab6):\r\n\r\n![fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32439298-21fcc03e-c2ff-11e7-963c-92051e217d9e.png)\r\n\r\n@MaEtUgR,

\r\n\r\nWe recently discovered some fairly dangerous behavior while experimenting on a robot running v1.6.5 stable on a Pixhawk Mini. The result is the robot arming and throttling up (i.e. taking off uncontrolled) without any way to stop it.\r\n\r\nHere's exactly how this happens (we've replicated it a few times now):\r\n1) Provide external vision position input\r\n2) Fly successfully in offboard mode\r\n3) Shut down external vision input/companion computer -> px4 goes into failsafe\r\n4) Turn off RC transmitter (without leaving offboard mode) -> after a few seconds, the PX4 arms!!! and shoots off! \r\n\r\nAt this point there is no way to control the px4 since both the companion computer and RC transmitter are off and disconnected.\r\n\r\nWhile it is obviously not good practice for the transmitter to be turned off while the px4 is still in offboard mode, I think especially indoors it is something that can happen easily and thus DANGEROUS. Generally, I think it is a bad idea for the system to arm when no external controller/commander is connected to it. \r\n\r\nLuckily, nobody got injured this time but it could have ended pretty badly...\r\n\r\nHope this can be helpful and/or prevent future accidents. \r\n\r\n-marc &

\r\n\r\nThis is a new bug which appeared after the fix from: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/7957. Before this fix, the drone would drop out of the sky. After this fix, it does not do that anymore. However, if the packet is interrupted in a very specific way, all communication on the i2c bus is lost.\r\n\r\nMy test setup to reproduce the problem is similar to the one used in issue https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/7951. On the i2c bus, I now attached a HMC5883 compass and an rgb LED.\r\n\r\nThe logic analyzer screenshots shows the last transmission before the bus was lost (no data and no clock signals seen after this). It appears that the lack of the ACK/NAK bit triggers the failure. These are some captures of failure cases. The marker indicates when the SDA line is pulled low.\r\n\r\n![missing nak](https://i.imgur.com/pIYwbMD.png)\r\n\r\n![missing nak 2](https://i.imgur.com/FeZNMoc.png)\r\n\r\nThis is another case where the bus broke down:\r\n![logicanal](https://i.imgur.com/o51fho9.png)\r\n\r\nAnd another one:\r\n![ackmissing2](https://i.imgur.com/Hlizda0.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7968/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7947","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7947/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7947/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7947/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7947","id":256508279,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTY1MDgyNzk=","number":7947,"title":"previous main state isn't changing","user":{"login":"garfieldG","id":27761531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzYxNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27761531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG","html_url":"https://github.com/garfieldG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garfieldG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-10T12:53:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T20:49:15Z","closed_at":"2017-09-18T20:49:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Looking at state_machine_helper cpp file we can see that we call main_state_transition function from inside set_link_loss_nav_state function.

But the MAIN 2 (right aileron) output remains always at 1500 which corresponds to a zero deflection.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be solved by removing the lines for the airbrakes ([L24](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/mixers/AAERTWF.main.mix#L24), [L29](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/mixers/AAERTWF.main.mix#L29)), or changing the index from 6 to a value lower than 4.
