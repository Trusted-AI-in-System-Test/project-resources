this issue again, the first one closed automatically with no response https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/10917\n\nI encountered a situation in which my drone reports it's position in global ( using POSITION_TARGET_GLOBAL_INT message), but receives position commands from offboard in local (SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED).\nBecause of the situation POSITION_TARGET_GLOBAL_INT that is reported to the GCS contains zeros in lat_int, lon_int and alt fields.\n\nI investigated it a little and noticed that it happens due to the fact that while the fcc is in offboard mode the only place that position_setpoint_triplet is published from is mavlink_receiver when receiving SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED message and there is no reference to current.lat, current.lon and current.alt there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11625/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11621","id":419460448,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTk0NjA0NDg=","number":11621,"title":"px4

the bug**\nAfter flying with tightly tuned multicopters in position control mode (basically a racer with a GPS), I realized some attitude twitches that I don't see in stabilized mode. I'm now able to see that those twitches are created by the velocity controller.\nIn the log below, you can see that the velocity setpoint and estimate is perfectly smooth and that the thrust/pitch/pitchrate setpoint have glitches.

The position setpoint then drift \"behind the scenes\" (because it's the integral of the non-zero velocity setpoint) and when the condition becomes again true, a severe position jump can occur. We had a jump of 10m due to a slow drift during a fixed hover of 1 min\n\nThis should **never** happen, but it seems that the trajectory generator fails to find a solution is some specific cases that lead to unexpected behaviors.\n\nThis PR doesn't fix the root cause of the problem, but at least, the drone will follow the drift (in my case, move 10m in 1min) and not do a sudden jump of 10m.\n\nI'm actively trying to find the root issue but this PR has to be merged as that behavior could cause severe damages.\n\nSee below the position jump in the y axis at

problem solved by the proposed pull request**\nNavigator parses ROI `vehicle_command` messages into `vehicle_roi` messages and keeps this info as a class member:\n\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/6762f094906cfd4c53d35e1b1ab5d1fb44bb2cc2/src/modules/navigator/navigator.h#L330\n\nThese `vehicle_command` messages can be triggered by specific mission items. Problem is that the navigator's information is never flushed/reset, except for when it's overwritten by a new ROI setting. \n\nIn the case where a mission with an ROI item is flown, followed by a mission without any ROI items, the navigator's member `_vroi` is outdated. Calling this\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/6762f094906cfd4c53d35e1b1ab5d1fb44bb2cc2/src/modules/navigator/navigator.h#L161\n\nwill therefore return information not matching the current mission.\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nThe proposed changes make navigator reset `_vroi` whenever a new mission is loaded. Missions with a ROI mission item will overwrite it anyway. In any event, calling `get_vroi()` always reflects the current mission's settings according to navigator.\n\n**Additional context**\nNote that navigator sends out a `vehicle_roi` uorb message when it receives a ROI command:\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/6762f094906cfd4c53d35e1b1ab5d1fb44bb2cc2/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L525-L532\n\nSo whatever component receives `vehicle_roi` messages might still have the old one buffered. I thought about re-sending an empty `vehicle_roi` message when resetting it in navigator, but decided against it:\n1. In many PX4 modules the last setting remains until specifically overwritten.\n2. Other modules might also publish `vehicle_roi` messages, in which case navigator's internal copy is outdated anyway. \n\nIn practice this doesn't change anything yet, except for that `Navigator::get_vroi` always returns the up-to-date ROI setting **from the navigator's perspective**.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11517/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11492","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11492/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11492/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11492/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11492","id":411640451,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTE2NDA0NTE=","number":11492,"title":"pixhawk

A parameter update happens when the mag is initialized and triggers\n   `VotedSensorsUpdate::parameters_update()` where `orb_copy` happens\n   before the main loop in `sensors` has started a `px4_poll`.\n3. `sensors` now does the `px4_poll`, however waits indefinitely because\n   it has already copied the latest sample.\n   Also, the `px4_poll` will never time out because in lockstep the\n   simulator waits for the next actuator control message which it never\n   gets and therefore it never sends the next sensor message with a new\n   timestamp to advance the time.\n\nThis only happens for fixedwing because there is only one \"uORB path\"\nthrough the system unlike for multicopter where a gyro sample can get\npicked up by either `sensors` or directly `mc_att_control`, so the\nsystem can survive if `sensors` has \"drops\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11485/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11477","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11477/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11477/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11477/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11477","id":411111265,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTExMTEyNjU=","number":11477,"title":"Irlock i2C communication problem with Pixhawk 2.1","user":{"login":"narew","id":10340960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQwOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10340960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew","html_url":"https://github.com/narew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narew/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1442627275,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQyNjI3Mjc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Sensors","name":"Sensors","color":"48c13e","default":false,"description":"All the sensors!"},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2019-02-16T20:39:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T07:33:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\nHello,\nI am trying to run Irlock (pixycam with a special filter on the lens + ir beacon) on Pixhawk 2.1 with the PX4 firmware. Unfortunately, irlock does not want to work.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Change the line 66 in src>drivers>irlock>irlock.cpp from \n#define IRLOCK_I2C_BUS\t\t\tPX4_I2C_BUS_EXPANSION\nto\n#define IRLOCK_I2C_BUS\t\t\tPX4_I2C_BUS_ONBOARD\nbecause for Pixhawk 2.1 onboard I2C is appropriate bus.\n2. Compile and upload the firmware (px4_fmu-v3_default) to Pixhawk 2.1. own compilation is necessary because by default the irlock is unsupported. \nThe: \n-drivers/irlock\n-modules/landing_target_estimator\nwere added for compilation as were sugessted in: https://docs.px4.io/en/advanced_features/precland.html\nUnfortunately, I do not know how to make the system start-up described in the above manual\n3. In the QGC thru MavlinkConsole test the range finder which also works on same I2C. It is for check the bus is ok. Used distance sensor is LidarLite and appriopriate command is: ll40ls info, ll40ls test\n![przechwytywanie0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10340960/52904684-9c618800-322f-11e9-9d68-ecc35c45d39c.PNG)\n4. Next in the console I start the irlock driver using command:\nirlock start (before change the bus from I2C EXPANSION to I2C ONBOARD I were used command irlock start -b 2)\n4. Check the communication by command: irlock info\n5. Make some test measurements by: irlock test\n![irlock failed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10340960/52904709-05490000-3230-11e9-89c4-c06b054f21e2.PNG)\n6. If the beacon is off nothing is happen and autopilot works as before, but if beacon is on then the console return some measurements and then communication with pixhawk 2.1 is reseted for a while or autopilot get restart\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe autopilot should be stable and return the local position given in the console from the irlock system. Without the solution of this problem, the precise landing function can not be used.\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\n- Describe the type of drone.\nQuad X type, with Pixhawk 2.1 and Here+ onboard. Radiomodem - RFD 868MHz and the range finder - LidarLite V3, RC tx Frsky X9E and rx X8R. Ground station on QGC v3.4.4, \n\n**Additional context**\nIrlock with described set were tested on Arducopter stack to eliminate possible hardware defects or connections. Irlock worked fine. So It looks there is a problem with the Irlock driver or I2C communication on PX4 stack for Pixhawk 2.1 hardware.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11477/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11467","id":410721932,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTA3MjE5MzI=","number":11467,"title":"vtol front transition height drop","user":{"login":"lingbuweibu","id":26177397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTc3Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26177397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu","html_url":"https://github.com/lingbuweibu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingbuweibu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":249514594,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDk1MTQ1OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Hybrid%20VTOL%20%F0%9F%9B%A9%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%9A%81","name":"Hybrid VTOL 🛩️🚁","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":"Multirotor + Fixedwing!"},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2019-02-15T11:17:11Z","updated_at":"2019-10-13T13:18:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I use 1.8.1 code.

When now the user moves the throttle stick above 50%, the setpoint has to go positive before triggering the smooth takeoff. However, with the dynamics of the smooth flight tasks, this takes and depends of some parameters such as the max down velocity, vertical acceleration and jerk limitations.\nI see two ways to solve that:\n1. Make the flight task aware of the current state (the flight task will then not output a downward sertpint while on ground)\n2. Modify the constraint in mc_pos_control and feet it back to the flight task (I tried that on a branch)\nThe problem is that both solutions introduce a feedback to the flight task and I know that @stifael wanted to avoid that. Do you have an other solution? \n\n**To Reproduce**\nIn position control mode (using a smoothing FlightTask with low vertical acceleration and jerk)\nSet the throttle stick to low\nArm and wait a few seconds\nRaise the stick above 50%, it will take some time before taking off\n\nTo avoid this issue :\n- Use a spring-loaded throttle stick or center the throttle stick before arming and use an arm switch\n- Arm and directly center the throttle stick\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe drone should takeoff as soon as the throttle stick is above 50%\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\n![takeoff_delay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822839/52703607-03a4e100-2f7f-11e9-987c-fcd97645893d.png)\n\n\n**Proposed solution**\nI tried the 2nd solution proposed in the description and limit the downward velocity constraint while the vehicle is on ground, here is the result:\n![smooth_takeoff_refactor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822839/52703817-7dd56580-2f7f-11e9-98ea-db9ad85ed406.png)\n\n@Stifael I know that you want to avoid having feedback to the FlightTask, but I can't find a cleaner solution. Let's discuss that here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11434","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11434/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11434/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11434/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11434","id":408799936,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjUxOTI3NTc3","number":11434,"title":"bmi055: fixes for on-chip filter","user":{"login":"bkueng","id":281593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/281593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng","html_url":"https://github.com/bkueng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":10884840,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDg0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/enhancement%20(improvement)%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"enhancement (improvement) 💡","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":945658723,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NDU2NTg3MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/pixhawk:%20fmu-v5","name":"pixhawk: fmu-v5","color":"a67bce","default":false,"description":"FMU-v5 including pixhawk 4, pixhack v5, etc"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/29/labels","id":3761959,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzc2MTk1OQ==","number":29,"title":"Release v1.9.0","description":"PX4 Stable Release v1.9.0","creator":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":137,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-23T14:25:59Z","updated_at":"2021-01-10T17:51:52Z","due_on":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-05-25T14:10:35Z"},"comments":9,"created_at":"2019-02-11T14:12:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T18:01:42Z","closed_at":"2019-02-21T17:30:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/11434","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11434","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11434.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11434.patch","merged_at":"2019-02-21T17:30:45Z"},"body":"While going through the BMI055 I noticed the on-chip filters are not configured as expected.\nThis changes:\n- Accel: use cutoff of 62.5 Hz instead of 500 Hz\n- Gyro: the cutoff frequency is coupled with the ODR and is fixed to 116 Hz\n  at 1 kHz readout rate.

issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11386","id":406997233,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDY5OTcyMzM=","number":11386,"title":"Issues

the bug**\nWhen I flash an omnibusf4 board I can not get the board to boot or connect to GQC. I have tried multiple Hobbywing XRotor Flight Controllers, the old and v2. I have tried multiple SDcards. I have used an SD card that is working in a Pixracer. I have compiled the FW on multiple computers. The only issue is see while building is, I can not upload because the FW is too large for the board. I removed some unneeded drivers to make it fit. PX4Flow, GPS, frsky_telemetry were the last drivers I tried disabling. I have tried V1.8.0 V1.8.2 and V1.9. Is anyone else seeing this? When I plug into QGC it never connects and I get an error to let the system fully boot and restart QGC. \n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. make omnibus_f4sd_default\n2. make omnibus_f4sd_default upload\n3. reboot board\n4. plug in to computer and open QGC\n\n**Expected behavior**\n          I expect the board to boot and connect to QGC.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\n

#4797 \n\n**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**\nThe VTOL attitude controller generates reversed fixed-wing roll commands. As a consequence, all VTOL mixers currently have a minus sign on roll actuators to compensate.\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\n- Fix sign of the fixed wing commands generated by the VTOL attitude controller\n- Fix builtin mixers\n- Add a parameter to force users of custom VTOL mixers to check roll control surfaces before flight\n- Fix builtin airframes scripts to bypass the new parameter\n\n**Flight testing**\nThis requires extensive flight testing on all possible VTOL platforms.\n\nTest card 1:\n- Flash firmware on VTOL\n- **Before flight**: Check direction of roll control surfaces\n- Fly standard mission, the behaviour should be unchanged\n\nTest card 2:\n- set parameter V19_VT_ROLLDIR to 1\n- try to arm\n- the system should not generate actuator commands, error messages should be displayed on QGC.\n- set parameter V19_VT_ROLLDIR to 0\n- arm

problem solved by the proposed pull request**\nInside a ROS context, there are currently two distinctive ways we can build packages inside a workspace: using `catkin tools` or using `colcon`. While the first one supports a *devel* space, the second one doesn't and installs the project according to the directives on the `CMakeLists.txt` files.\n\nSo, while using `catkin tools`, the solution would work as expected, since everything will be set and under a *devel* space, when using an *install* space, things wouldn't work properly, as we are not installing the required files onto the expected directories.\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nThe solution was to get into the posix platform build structure, specifically for the sitl target, and rearrange the install dirs, in a way that they match the expected organisation for a ROS workspace. While this continues to work in a normal raw CMake build, the current install dirs also allow it to work inside a ROS workspace.\n\n**Additional context**\nTo test it, one can use and install `colcon` on his system (assuming that you have ROS installed already). If you are under a ROS 1 context:\n```sh\n$ sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'\n$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116\n$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions\n```\n\nThen, to build PX4 under a ROS1 workspace:\n```sh\n$ mkdir -p colcon_ws/src\n$ cd colcon_ws/src\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/PX4/Firmware\n$ ln -s Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo mavlink_sitl_gazebo\n$ colcon build --event-handlers console_direct+\n```\n\nThe above can also be tested using `catkin` by setting an `install` space: `catkin config --install`.\n\nThen, to test if it works, first source your workspace using `source install/local_setup.bash` (or `setup.bash` for the `catkin` case). Then, try running one of the launch files: `roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch`. If all was properly set, the Gazebo simulation with PX4 SITL and MAVROS will launch as they should.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11364","id":405717819,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDU3MTc4MTk=","number":11364,"title":"VEHICLE_CMD_DO_REPOSITION scaling check invalid for negative lat/lon","user":{"login":"blutack","id":348305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODMwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/348305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack","html_url":"https://github.com/blutack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blutack/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1450324872,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDUwMzI0ODcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Communication%20(MAVLink)%20%F0%9F%93%A1","name":"Communication (MAVLink) 📡","color":"f66608","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2019-02-01T14:11:55Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T09:53:10Z","closed_at":"2019-12-18T09:52:53Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\nVEHICLE_CMD_DO_REPOSITION [attempts to do a sanity check](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/225115087510c6287fc1d28593f240fe3c214269/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L356) to handle both scaled and unscaled lat/lon. If the lat or lon are over 1000, the value is assumed to be scaled and divided down. However, this check is not valid for locations south of the equator or west of the meridian because the values will be negative and therefore below 1000.\n\n```\nrep->current.lat = (cmd.param5 < 1000) ? cmd.param5 : cmd.param5 / (double)1e7;\nrep->current.lon = (cmd.param6 < 1000) ? cmd.param6 : cmd.param6 / (double)1e7;\n```\n\nOne way to correct the bug could be:\n\n```\nrep->current.lat = (abs(cmd.param5) < 1000) ? cmd.param5 : cmd.param5 / (double)1e7;\nrep->current.lon = (abs(cmd.param6) < 1000) ? cmd.param6 : cmd.param6 / (double)1e7;\n```\n\nOn it's own this would not be a particularly serious issue, as sending scaled up values via COMMAND_LONG is invalid. However, the default simulation locations are in regions where this bug does not occur. Therefore, code which appears to work correctly in sim can cause a flyaway in real flight.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Send a COMMAND_LONG with LAT and LON as integers multiplied by 10^7 with negative latitude or longitude\n2. Aircraft will attempt to fly off to an impossible location setpoint (example 50.0001, -2400000)\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAircraft should not attempt to fly to an impossible location.\nIt should either:\na) correctly scale down values which are negative\nb) do not do the sanity check at all, in which case invalid lat/lon would also fail in simulation\nc) reject the reposition command if values are not in expected valid ranges for lat/lon","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11360","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11360/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11360/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11360/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11360","id":405484109,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjQ5NDM1OTE5","number":11360,"title":"VTOL

broken)\n- lockstep #10648 because of simulator threads not stopping gracefully anymore with timing race conditions (no graceful exit possible anymore)\n\n**Describe your solution**\nI leave the SIGINT handler on its default implementation for Cygwin which kills the process and all its threads when pressing Ctrl+C.\n\nThis hotfix at least allows the usage of Ctrl+C again instead of forcing the user to use the task manager to shut down px4.exe going crazy on CPU load instead of exiting everytime.\n\n**Describe possible alternatives**\nAn analysis of what exactly goes wrong when trying to exit gracefully would be the desired way but my limited experience with debugging the overly complex thread structure of PX4 through multiple wrapping layers and my already spent countless hours on

the bug**\nThe CI stck check very frequently times out, so CI fails even though there might be no issue with a PR.\n\nTo reproduce, rebase a previously passing PR against current master, the CI tools will re-run, and frequently the stack check will fail with a timeout.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497951/51648430-c8922d80-1f3d-11e9-8b34-ebc3d55b4e4b.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497951/51648470-e52e6580-1f3d-11e9-9b00-672f73081a3a.png)\n\nAt the time of this writing, these three PR's can be observed exhibiting this behavior:\nhttp://ci.px4.io:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/PX4_misc%2FFirmware-hardware/detail/PR-11260/11/pipeline\nhttp://ci.px4.io:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/PX4_misc%2FFirmware-hardware/detail/PR-11192/33/pipeline\nhttp://ci.px4.io:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/PX4_misc%2FFirmware-hardware/detail/PR-11194/20/pipeline\n\n**Expected behavior**\n@dagar, if a timeout has been exceeded, is there a way to make the CI test retry/restart again after a wait period?  Currently I wait for the master branch to update, then rebase and force push again in hopes of getting through... (As a bonus, when it does pass after a rebase, the experience is a lot like winning the lottery! :) Unfortunately, rebasing again often leads to a new failure.)\n\nLet me know if I can help provide additional information.

the bug**\nIntermittently, the aircraft, when powered on and sitting on the ground with no RC transmitter turned on, will print out that it lost RC control, arm itself, spin up the motors, then switch into LAND failsafe because  GPS hasn't locked yet. The problem seems somewhat intermittent, but we can go for stretches of hours where it will do it on every boot. \n\nLogs of the event show that it receives input_rc messages every 3-20 seconds, with  SOURCE=RC_INPUT_SOURCE_MAVLINK and 8 channels of 65535 values. When looking at the scaled manual control inputs in the log viewer, that gives an almost full yaw command and zero throttle, which may be the source of the arming.\n\n\nWe also have ensured that the RC_IN lines while not connected to an RC transmitter are not floating electrically. \n\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Unplug RC receiver, and remove props!\n2. Power on aircraft \n3. Wait\n4. Sometimes it will arm and takeoff.\n\n(Note that in our case we have the CBRK_IO_SAFETY set so that is NOT necessary to press the safety switch before launch), otherwise the arm would be prevented.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nWe expect the aircraft to sit there and never arm\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nBecause the system arms, it starts logging. here are some logs from the events. It is worth noting that the input_rc message in the logs show a few received values, even though there are no  RC receivers connected, and the source is listed as MAVLINK.\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4abb3756-1202-4d7f-93df-7278dcec0897\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d12666c6-faed-4645-bc04-0d5a94d05116\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=508c3766-012d-4a24-a538-80235388be71\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=2f046532-ae41-4327-b683-57cdfe3e1d70\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7cd79b51-c6b8-4ee0-9b33-311ef4f6c0ae\n\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\nOur  system is based on a custom adapter board with a Pixhawk 2.1 cube on it, a wifi module, and a long range radio. The adapter board has an MCU that can communicate with the cube. In order to rule out all external sources of mavlink traffic, we wiped the adapter MCU and disabled the wifi serial port and unplugged long range RF, and can still get it to happen. Our PX4 code fork is based on 1.7.3 release with a custom CAN driver for our ESCs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11236","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11236/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11236/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11236/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11236","id":400780907,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjQ1ODg5MTMz","number":11236,"title":"ROMFS

the bug**\nThrottle output thrust drop to 0 (zero) after forward FW transition is completed in any mode that has auto throttle control. This happens randomly, some flight does, some flight don't. Same configuration, same aircraft, same location.\n\nRight after forward transition, the aircraft dropped throttle output from forward transition throttle value to zero as shown on the log below. \nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5f2f02c7-d2bd-4ff3-9d10-c48c87272d2f\n\n![throttle drop1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2929677/51170909-268d9800-18e2-11e9-84b2-8bf6c784387e.png)\n\nThis behavior also occurred in any other mode that has auto throttle control (Altitude, Position) but does not always occur on every flight. The log below is the flight without this behavior.\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4eed6594-9aaf-4026-a571-202857b4c387\n\n![throttle not drop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2929677/51170920-30170000-18e2-11e9-8a4d-04d18d5eb008.png)\n\nBesides the above log which is from an actual flight test, we also conducted bench test in position mode to reproduce this behavior. The throttle drop also occurred in the same way as the actual flight test. The logs from bench test are presented below.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior (on bench-test):\n1. Put the aircraft in position mode (multi-rotor).\n2. Arm the aircraft.\n3. Raise throttle input to be above 50%.\n4. Raise the aircraft itself by hand.\n5. Flip the transition switch from MC to FW.\n6. Flip the aircraft from vertical to horizontal orientation (this is a tailsitter) \n7. Accelerate the airflow in the front of the aircraft from 0 m/s to transition airspeed gradually.\n8. Aircraft should switch from MC to FW and throttle should drops to zero.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThrottle should not drop to zero and causing it to be uncontrollable.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nFirst figure (throttle drop): https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5f2f02c7-d2bd-4ff3-9d10-c48c87272d2f\n2nd figure (throttle not drop):

think I found the root cause of the problem addressed in #11167\n\n**_The first commit is the fix the second is refactoring only._**\n\n**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**\nThe idle time configured by `MPC_IDLE_TKO` does not always get executed. There's a race-condition between arming, when the flight task gets started and the takeoff. This inconsistently results in not awaiting the configured idle time and if awaited still too abrupt takeoffs without a proper takeoff ramp. See the excellent description of @bresch in #11167.\n\n**Describe your solution**\nThe required flight task should get started at the exact time we want to take off. It was started when arming and the takeoff happened later. This change is necessary because otherwise the task produces setpoints, the land detector detects a takeoff but the takeoff did not happen yet because it's delayed by the `arm_hysteresis` (which I refactored to the name `takeoff_delay_hysteresis` because I think it better describes what it does).\n\n**Test data / coverage**\nA lot of SITL

This noise can be observed in the screenshot below\nchan1_raw displays the raw input on the SUMD channel 1. As you can see there are frequently spikes (of partly different heights) in the actually constant sent value of 1500.\n\nFor further debug I inspected the decoded SUMD signal, that is published to its subscribers (such as mavlink debug). All decoded SUMD channels (which can be seen in the screenshot as M1:rc_sumd_i) are exactly as they are meant to be - a constant value of 1500.\n\nLong story short: subscribers of the RCInput component receive a faulty, noisy value, despite the channel is received correctly.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Connect SUMD RC receiver to pixhawk\n2. Power on Pixhawk\n3. Observe noisy Channels on Channel monitor in QGroundControl\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expected that all subscribers of RCInput should receive the correctly decoded SUMD signal.\n\n**Log Files and

This is due to the introduction of extraneous bus options in #10116. Specifically the bus options for `MPU_DEVICE_PATH_MPU6500_*` . These options used the name exact CS, path, etc as the non **6500** option, however the `dev` pointer was still NULL, so it tried to start the bus. \n\n**To reproduce**\nThis problem behavior can easily be observed by issuing an `mpu9250 start` via the NSH after the system has booted. \n\n**Solution** \nI've removed the **6500** bus options. These are not necessary, as the device type will be discovered via the **WHOAMI** register (besides, the only difference between the 6500 and 9250 is the mag). I've also removed the extra bus options for the ICM20948 as they do not appear to be used. \n\n\n\n@flochir Could you please test this to make sure everything is still good on your end?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11189","id":397984400,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjQzODA2NDYw","number":11189,"title":"Fix driver load order for external ICM20948/Here GNSS for Pixhawk Cube","user":{"login":"flochir","id":38494856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDk0ODU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38494856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir","html_url":"https://github.com/flochir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flochir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/29/labels","id":3761959,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzc2MTk1OQ==","number":29,"title":"Release v1.9.0","description":"PX4 Stable Release v1.9.0","creator":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":137,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-23T14:25:59Z","updated_at":"2021-01-10T17:51:52Z","due_on":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-05-25T14:10:35Z"},"comments":12,"created_at":"2019-01-10T19:41:23Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T17:01:39Z","closed_at":"2020-08-14T17:01:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/11189","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11189","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11189.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11189.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"With the driver load in rc.sensors, the external ICM20948 magnetometer on Here GNSS gets activated as last (and 4th) magnetometer on Pixhawk Cube.

Unreliable ICM20948 detection due to wrong register bank selected after flight control reboot, so read of WHOAMI returned wrong value.\n\n2. Broken ICM20948 magnetometer only option, defect by use of (in mag only mode) non-existent magnetometer device file.\n\n3. Driver for internal mpu9250 on Pixhawk 2.1 was loaded (in rc.board) without the bus specified and found the external ICM20948 instead. This activated the external sensor in full IMU mode, but with the wrong orientation, and blocked the activation of the internal mpu9250.  Due to this, the proper entry for ICM20948 in rc.sensors didn't load either.\n\nFixes:\n1. Fixed by trying to set the register bank before reading ICM20948 WHOAMI and after neither MPU9250 or MPU6500 found. This triggers one I2C register write to a not fully detected device though (but on the correct address).\n\n2. Implemented get_whoami() method on driver and using this get detected device type in main.cpp. For MPU6500 (no mag there), always using accelerometer device file. Using magnetometer device file for MPU9250 and ICM20948 (always there, even in magnetometer only mode).\n\n3. Specified bus for internal mpu9250 on Pixhawk 2.1 to avoid premature detection of\nother device (especially external ICM20948 in Here GPS, getting initialized with wrong orientation and in full IMU mode instead of magnetometer only, while internal MPU9250 is not used at all while GPS connected)\n\nAlso see #11019","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11167","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11167/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11167/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11167/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11167","id":396861119,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjQyOTM5NzUy","number":11167,"title":"Multicopter land detector -

the bug**\nOn the process of testing the micro RTPS bridge between a SITL client (with Gazebo) and the agent, I get the following warning msgs on the output of the `nsh` console:\n```sh\nWARN  [px4] commander: px4_sem_timedwait failure: ret: 110, Connection timed out\nWARN  [cdev] commander: px4_poll() sem error: Success\nWARN  [px4] commander: px4_sem_timedwait failure: ret: 110, Connection timed out\nWARN  [cdev] commander: px4_poll() sem error: Success\n```\nwhich repeat themselves over time. The same does not happen if one builds the posix build using `_default` instead of `_rtps`.\n\nI am testing latest upstream master. This may have been introduced by the latest changes on SITL and with the lockstep feature.\n\nI am currently trying to find if this is just a warning or if this is introducing some sort of problem or breaking some functionality. Though, this wasn't happening before.\n\n@julianoes @MaEtUgR any tips on what's causing this?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nPlatform: Ubuntu 18.04 with Gazebo 9.\n\n1. Clone upstream master;\n2. Issue `make px4_sitl_rtps gazebo`;\n3. Observe the above lines on the `nsh` console output.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nA clean console output.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\n![screenshot from 2018-12-31

coverage**\nSITL on Windows\n\n**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**\nPWMSim needs to always publish `actuator_outputs` such that lock-step works when disarmed (see https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/10648/). But after it was changed the controller output gets applied even if diarmed because there's nothing holding it back anymore. As a result the drone takes off if the controller would command more than hover thrust on SITL boot even when the drone is disarmed.\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nI added the armed check from before when the values get set to their in flight values instead of the disarmed value here: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/compare/fix-pwm-sim?expand=1#diff-2ce77a8bbb7b5dc57a3e7b1db5dacb18R256 The rest is just refactoring.\n\n**Describe possible alternatives**\nI think running the controllers even when disarmed is very useful not only for debugging but also to see before arming if anything would go wrong in terms of exceptions, CPU usage, crazy output and so on. But for the future it would probably make sense to unify mixing and armed handling of all outputs to increase maintainability and make sure it's treated the same in any case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11110","id":394623062,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTQ2MjMwNjI=","number":11110,"title":"Snapdragon

We experienced the following when doing mission upload at further distances (50m-200m from ground-control). \n\n1. --> Sending mission count\n2. <-- Getting mission_request_int(0)\n3. --> Sending mission_item_int(0)\n4. <-- Getting mission_request_int(0)\n5. <-- Getting mission_request_int(0)\n6. <-- Getting mission_request_int(1)\n7. --> Sending mission_item_int(1)\n8. <-- Getting mission_request_int(1)\n...\n9. <-- Getting mission_accepted\n10. <-- Getting mission_accepted\n11. <-- Getting mission_accepted\n(Often end up getting 4-5 acknowledges back)\n\nSo due to the timeout and the time it takes to send the information we are getting flooded with requests for the same already sent item. If my ground-control reacts on every request, as the protocol dictates, then I will have sent the same item multiple times, which then gives more answers back. In total this delayed our mission upload by 5-8seconds due to telemetry bandwidth. The mission was only 6 waypoints. If we changed so the ground-control only sent every item once, the mission upload would be 5-8s faster. This is a major gain when doing dynamic path-planning. \n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nMake it possible to set a parameter that determines the timeout of mission items. Make the user able to optimise the timeout based on his ground-control, distance and use-case. \n\n**Describe possible alternatives**\nIncreasing the timeout for mission_timeouts in the code. However, this would break following the default Mavlink protocol, and thus making it a parameter would probably be a better solution. \n\n**Additional context**\nAs I could see, then other commands have a timeout of 5s, and thus should be fine for longer distances. We so far only experienced the problem with the mission_upload.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11076","id":392876827,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTI4NzY4Mjc=","number":11076,"title":"missing

I am using a PX4FLOW and a Lidar Lite v3 for range data and I am flying without GPS. I am using fmu-v3 (master) with a small alteration to make the Lidar boot before the PX4FLOW (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/11009).\n\nFrom the logs I see that my local position estimates vary wildly at the beginning until I get the error and, after that, the estimating stops (obviously). However, the condition_local_position_valid flag drops to zero even before EKF stops navigation and it never goes back to one. Here is an example of a short test I did this morning:\n\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=95d3f262-f3ef-4dea-9398-91dcce53d245\n\nI was flying outdoors and neither take-off nor landing were exactly smooth. I thought it might be an issue with the PX4FLOW, but I have tried both indoors and outdoors flights on floors with different textures and the quality data I get seems to be good enough. Also, even though the acceleration power spectral density data is not ideal, I get much better values indoors and yet I still get the same error, so I doubt vibration is an issue.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11070","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11070/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11070/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11070/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11070","id":392233741,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTIyMzM3NDE=","number":11070,"title":"Mavlink rate control still doesn't follow target rate","user":{"login":"jasonbeach","id":2664807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQ4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2664807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonbeach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonbeach/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1450324872,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDUwMzI0ODcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Communication%20(MAVLink)%20%F0%9F%93%A1","name":"Communication (MAVLink) 📡","color":"f66608","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":21,"created_at":"2018-12-18T16:25:13Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T10:22:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\nI would like to stream HIGHRES_IMU and ATTITUDE at 200Hz, but adding these lines in etc/extras.txt results in them streaming at ~160 - 170 Hz:\n\nmavlink start -d /dev/ttyACM0 -b 921600 -m onboard -r 80000\nmavlink stream -d /dev/ttyACM0 -s ATTITUDE -r 200\nmavlink stream -d /dev/ttyACM0 -s HIGHRES_IMU -r 200\n\nIt seems exactly like \nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/3291\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/6235\nwhich are closed.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nRunning v1.8.1 with Nuttx 7.22.0 on a pixracer, but issue seems to also occur on a pixhawk.

problem solved by the proposed pull request**\n- MAVLink message struct was not explicitly initialized which did not cause any problems but better be safe than sorry.\n- The orbit radius setter did just not set a radius that's out of range but in practice the lead to executing the orbit with a default radius when the command contains an out of range radius. In the future this should be handled by denying the execution completely but as a hotfix clipping to the closest possible radius rather than taking the default is already better.\n\n**Additional

But, it doesnt work for me.\n\nKindly help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11045/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11044","id":391203875,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjM4Nzk0MjU5","number":11044,"title":"ROMFS

a survey, we saw a weird behaviour at the first turn point. Reaching the turning point, the copter started to tumble violently and loose height. Quickly toggling to altitude and then position to stop the mission didn't stop the behaviour. The machine crashed into the ground tumbling, stayed grounded for a few seconds, and took off again, now hovering stable in position mode.\n\nThe tumbling seems to start with a jump of the yaw setpoint. At mission start the machine had a successfully yaw into flight direction however.\n\nThe tuning and general reaction tested before the survey in position and altitude mode seemed very stable.\n\nAny hints on possible reasons are very appreciated!\n\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=c7976cfc-d926-4596-ae1a-44c4e216800b","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11041/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},
