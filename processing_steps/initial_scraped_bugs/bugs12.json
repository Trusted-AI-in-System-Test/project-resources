is some bad system behavior we've observed in legacy firmware (between v1.8-v1.9) related to airspeed data disappearing, for example if the I2C bus flakes out or if power is lost to the airspeed sensor.\r\n\r\nI submit this for review against the new airspeed selector work @sfuhrer and others are contributing in hopes the new airspeed features will robustly handle these difference cases.\r\n\r\nIf airspeed data suddenly disappears there are several bad behaviors:\r\n\r\n1. The system seems to keep sending the last known airspeed reading down the MAVlink pipe to the ground station (might need to be verified).  It should instead stop sending airspeed data if no new data is available.\r\n\r\n2. There are no warnings to the user that airspeed data has gone missing. There should be some warning inidcation if airspeed data is expected but disappeared.  There should also be an indication if it returns.  (note: similar data disappeared, data returned indications should be extended to all sensor types).\r\n\r\n3. On a failed takeoff, if the autopilot stops receiving airspeed data, the LandDetector may think the vehicle is still flying because the last reported airspeed still seems to be piping into the system. The motor may still run at full throttle! Ideally airpseed would stop updating and \"zero\" or \"null\" would be reported and the system would understand that it should not be using airspeed as part of the LandDetector.\r\n\r\n4. If airspeed disappears during flight there is no indication that it disappeared. TECS will silently switch to non-airspeed mode and not tell the user and by-passes the airspeed failsafe functionality. There should be warning indications and the airspeed failsafe functionality should be followed.\r\n\r\nHere are some flight logs showing the last example of airspeed data disappearing during the middle of a flight:\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=d378dac5-1061-444d-ba8d-ee911c6315cf\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=35be23c2-6bdf-4caa-9075-f9805b6d2035\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=5ffc7018-9793-4b88-89a3-8066988b1e54\r\n\r\nFYI

of the geofence again but things have changed: There's now the rc override by sticks and the pilot can come out by switching mode since https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/12057.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nEven though there are more problems than just this one I prefer to not accidentally switch out of the geofence reaction just by letting go of the stick. E.g. Full forward position mode -> RTL reaction -> let go of the stick -> position mode -> confusion. That why I propse to treat geofence like a critical battery in this regard and don't override the reaction by sticks.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nThe goal geofence implementation I would pursue does not siwtch out of position mode but prevents you from even ever exceeding the virtual fence similar to collision prevention. This implementation can then be reused for maximum altitude and so on.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nSITL testing.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/13613 should definitely go in first! I'll rebase.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13693","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13693/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13693/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13693/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13693","id":534030467,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzUwMDA1MTU0","number":13693,"title":"navigator: do not use fixed wing acceptance radius if in rotary wing…","user":{"login":"RomanBapst","id":7610489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTA0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7610489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst","html_url":"https://github.com/RomanBapst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RomanBapst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":249514594,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDk1MTQ1OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Hybrid%20VTOL%20%F0%9F%9B%A9%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%9A%81","name":"Hybrid VTOL 🛩️🚁","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":"Multirotor + Fixedwing!"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-12-06T14:31:23Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T17:52:14Z","closed_at":"2019-12-24T17:52:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/13693","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13693","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13693.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13693.patch","merged_at":"2019-12-24T17:52:11Z"},"body":"This is an attempt to fix an issue which can seen in this [log file](https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=47b2b562-bd40-4137-ae46-ef34d17d5f21)\r\nWhat happens is that the VTOL starts to descend after the back-transition prior to arriving at the actual waypoint. This can be very dangerous e.g. when the vehicle is pushed away from the land waypoint during the transition. It will then start to descend while moving toward the land waypoint.\r\nThe behavior should be that the vehicle keeps altitude until it has reached the landing waypoint.\r\n\r\nI have first reproduced this behavior on 1.9.2 but it only happened once in a while and appeared to be a race condition. I figured out that in some cases the navigator was using the acceptance radius from the fixed wing position controller in order to determine if the landing waypoint has been reached. This is a bug as the fixed wing acceptance radius can be very large and should not be used during hover.\r\nI believe this fix here solves the issue on 1.9.2.\r\n\r\nHowever, when testing the same fix on master I figured that there is a new problem in master.\r\nFor some reason the altitude setpoint of the position_setpoint_triplet.current is set to a very low value (6m) right at the start of the back-transition. This value is then further used as altitude setpoint during the horizonal movement during the landing waypoint. I'm not sure what causes this but the effect is again that the vehicle descends while moving towards the land waypoint. This needs further investigation.\r\n\r\nThis can easily be reproduced in SITL using the standard vtol model.\r\nI'm further uploading the mission file which can be used to reproduce the problem. You might need to change the file extension to .plan\r\n[vtol_mission.LOG](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3932587/vtol_mission.LOG)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13690","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13690/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13690/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13690/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13690","id":533928366,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzQ5OTE0ODUy","number":13690,"title":"Fix check for negative scaled lat lon on VEHICLE_CMD_DO_REPOSITION ","user":{"login":"BazookaJoe1900","id":29940676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTQwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29940676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900","html_url":"https://github.com/BazookaJoe1900","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BazookaJoe1900/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2019-12-06T12:09:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T09:50:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-18T08:48:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/13690","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13690","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13690.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13690.patch","merged_at":"2019-12-18T08:48:31Z"},"body":"**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nas described on 'VEHICLE_CMD_DO_REPOSITION scaling check invalid for negative lat/lon #11364:\r\n\r\nVEHICLE_CMD_DO_REPOSITION attempts to do a sanity check to handle both scaled and unscaled lat/lon.

working on using the ST16 Controller with pixhawk. The receiver is the SR24, also used with the ST24, which is a protocol included with pixhawk. I use QGC and connect the pixhawk via USB, and then connect the SR24 receiver, which is already bound to the ST16 controller). Once the receiver is connected to the spkt/dsm port, all 12 channels appear with the correct stick positions in the channel monitor, but QGC immediately warns \"Manual control lost\" and the channels do not react to changes in stick position. This can be reproduced by unplugging and re-inserting the SR24 receiver again, but does not occur when starting pixhawk with the SR24 connected. I had hoped to figure this out myself but I do not have the coding knowledge to debug the ST24 protocol implementation or debug in QGC. With my limited coding knowledge my best guess is that the RC test is working correctly and it is decoding at least one packet, but there is a bug in the decoder itself.

how.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13654","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13654/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13654/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13654/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13654","id":530971341,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MzA5NzEzNDE=","number":13654,"title":"camera_feedback

the bug**\r\n I am experiencing an incompatibility between Navio2 and PX4 v1.9.2 in controlling the PWM output to the esc. \r\n- In particular, is not possible to make a successful ESC calibration since the device file ``/dev/pwm_output0`` does not exist ( there is a drive here `` /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0 ``) and the result is that the motors do a strange sound when arming. \r\n- Moreover, 90% of the parameters in the PWM Output category do not exist for the Navio.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to the closed #11743, that was solved by switching to APM...(I can confirm that it works without problem, but it is not a solution for me).\r\n\r\nI am wondering how could I turn the driver under `` /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0 `` into the expected device file and if anyone ever was able to fly using PX4 with a NAVIO2 board.\r\n\r\n**Drone:**\r\n- PX4 V1.9.2\r\n- S500 frame with a Navio2 autopilot.\r\n- 4 Blheli_s 32bits 30A ESC\r\n- 4 T-motor MN3110 780KV\r\n\r\nThank you for your help in avance,

So it could be removed completely.\r\n\r\n### Improve 4 and 2 side calibration\r\nThe idea is that an initial 6 sided (factory-) calibration is done, and then a two-sided calibration is sufficient later on.\r\nSo this PR changes:\r\n- if less than 6 sides are calibrated, keep the existing calibration and update the offsets and scales\r\n- if 2 sides are calibrated, estimate the offsets only (as this is enough if a full calibration was done already, and the problem is not constrained enough to estimate scales and offsets - I got consistently wrong results even if the required calibration is very close to identity).\r\n\r\nTested on different boards, with different number of sides.

race conditions (they all happen between the check of existence of a topic and trying to create the node):\r\n- single instance, with multiple advertisers during the first advertise:\r\n  both advertisers see the topic as non-existent and try to advertise it.\r\n  One of them will fail, leading to an error message.\r\n  This is the cause for `telemetry_status` advert failure seen in SITL in\r\n  rare cases.\r\n- multi-instance: subscription to non-existing instance -> px4_open fails,\r\n  and the subscriber tries to create the node. If during that time a\r\n  publisher publishes that instance, the subscriber will get (instance+1)\r\n  (or fails if the max number of instances is exceeded).\r\n  This is a race that goes pretty much unnoticed.\r\n- multi-instance: 2 publishers can get the same instance (if is_published()\r\n  is false in case both have not published data yet).\r\n  This can also go unnoticed.\r\n- 2 single-instance advertisers, and they both open a node exclusively during advertisement, and one of them will fail to open the node with -EBUSY.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all of them, and there should be no noticeable changes for the rest of the system.\r\n\r\nThere's a semantic change for the flag `_published` to `_advertised`. This does not change anything for the system, since a topic was required to do a publication when advertised.\r\nThe change is however required to avoid race conditions.\r\nIt also allows to do an advertisement w/o data publication, avoiding the need for garbage/zeroed data publication on startup at many places.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits as

Later, when RTL is engaged, the flight task will use IDLE until navigator (which runs slower) has published the next triplet.\r\n\r\nThe fix involves two main changes:\r\n- Publish invalid triplets to avoid stale triplets.\r\n- Avoid publishing the triplet on every iteration in manual modes by not setting `_pos_sp_triplet_published_invalid_once = false`.\r\n\r\nWhen testing this I realized that a mission upload during RTL would stop RTL. This is because the mission is updated while the mission navigation mode is not active and reset_triplets() is called from there. This is now only done for the case where we are actually in mission navigation\r\nmode. The fact that a mission is updated when not active also seems wrong and is something to fix another time.\r\n\r\nFixes #13533.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13534/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13533","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13533/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13533/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13533/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13533","id":525677098,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MjU2NzcwOTg=","number":13533,"title":"Throttle quickly goes to 0 on RTL init after idle HOLD/RTL on ground","user":{"login":"julianoes","id":1419688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes","html_url":"https://github.com/julianoes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":78699954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODY5OTk1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Multirotor%20%F0%9F%9B%B8","name":"Multirotor 🛸","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1443093719,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQzMDkzNzE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Failsafe","name":"Failsafe","color":"1f7c00","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-11-20T09:24:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T15:29:42Z","closed_at":"2019-11-23T15:29:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nWe found the corner case where throttle intermittently went to 0 when RTL is engaged.\r\nThe reason seems to be a faulty logic of triplet resetting and publishing in navigator.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, navigator publishes an idle setpoint while in HOLD on ground:\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/84fe64b1c20a4ae8067f04b1e21a961263bac4db/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L662-L666\r\n\r\nthen in POSCTL the triplet is set to invalid\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/84fe64b1c20a4ae8067f04b1e21a961263bac4db/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L675-L679\r\n\r\nbut not published because it's invalid.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/84fe64b1c20a4ae8067f04b1e21a961263bac4db/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L730-L736\r\n\r\nSo later when switching to RTL, flight task still has the idle setpoint until navigator has run and published the new RTL setpoint.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior in SITL with QGC and a joystick set-up:\r\n1. Start SITL, wait for GPS\r\n2. Switch mode to HOLD, arm, then disarm without taking off\r\n3. Arm and takeoff in POSCTL\r\n4. Switch to RTL. This is when the spike to 0 usually happens.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\n@bresch found that when switching from stabilized mode to any position controlled mode the first sample of thrust setpoint output can be a huge spike that makes the drone twitch. He also found out that it's correlated to the velocity you have when switching modes. And after digging more we realized that the derivative for the D-term of the position controller does not get reset and hence the first sample is based on the difference between velocity before switching to stabilized and after switching back to a position controlled mode.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThe `BlockDerivative` class handles proper initialization but only through the constructor so I'm adding a `reset()` function to repeat that later on. When no position controlled mode is running I continuously call this `reset()` function which only sets an internal flag.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nNot tested. @bresch please verify with the test you had yesterday to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is an inportant enough issue to backport the low complexity fix to 1.10. I'll create a pr once it's verified. **EDIT:** Done here: #13524\r\n\r\nfixes

In this case, the aircraft briefly behaves as if in position mode, until it gets a valid current setpoint. \r\nWhen going in and out of mission mode however, since the last setpoint is never set as invalid by the navigator, the position controller enters directly at the altitude of the last position setpoint. This is particularly problematic when using altitude foh, where for the same mission item, the altitude setpoint could be very different depending on the plane's current altitude.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. With a valid mission, with a first waypoint at 100m for this example, arm the vehicle and take off in stabilized mode\r\n2. At altitude 1 (say 30m), enter mission mode\r\n3. Exit mission mode and climb manually to altitude 2 (say 90m)\r\n4. At altitude 2, enter mission mode again. The TECS altitude setpoint gets set below the aircraft. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nMaybe the aircraft should behave the same way when entering mission mode for the second time and for the first time (assume invalid waypoint until navigator sends the new one).\r\n\r\nFor this, we could force the position setpoint to be invalidated by the navigator when exiting mission mode.

When HITL\r\nis configured, the px4io copy of the uOrb has all zeros.\r\n\r\nThe result is that there are two publications, one valid, and one\r\nall-zeros. This causes the HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS mavlink message\r\nto be incorrect (all-zeros) and the SERVO_OUTPUTS_RAW mavlink\r\nmessage to be inconsistent, as it takes the data from one or the\r\nother uOrb randomly each cycle.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to let px4io know that HITL is in effect when it is\r\nstarted, and modify px4io to suppress publication in this case.\r\n\r\nThis is a bigger more complicated fix than I would like, but I\r\nthink it is conceptually correct.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to change src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_messages.cpp so that\r\nMavlinkStreamHILActuatorControls() explicitly subscribed to instance 1 of the uOrb:\r\n\r\n         _act_sub(_mavlink->add_orb_subscription(ORB_ID(actuator_outputs), 1)), _act_time(0)\r\n\r\nThat's a one-line solution, but I think it is incorrect because nothing enforces which pub of the uOrb is instance 0 and which is instance 1. And, I just think it doesn't make sense to have two pubs.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI simply verified that the failure case in #13471 is fixed.

have flight three times with my vtol plane two days ago. In the last flight,  during loiter mode at 280meters, the plane start to descent its altitude. I commanded RTL at 25meters and it return back to home but It still losing altitude during rtl mode. RTL altitude set to 40m but the plane did not climbout to 40m during rtl mode. I switch to manual at about 10 meters and landed the plane. Loiter mode does not appear in flight log records. I think that fw control module stops to work in air. The plane did not try to reach cruise airspeed during this period. Actually, it did not try to correct anything. \r\n\r\nAfter landing, I was able to run lifter motors, servos and pusher motor. The plane was able to take off and landing normally after landing. There was no hardware problem. You can see easily, there is long dropout on flightlog at all plots. You can watch the flight from \"Open 3D View\", the plane was flying backwards bcause of dropouts on log file.\r\n\r\nFlight log: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=ecc40545-1384-4185-828e-c14322655122","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13474","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13474/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13474/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13474/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13474","id":523087908,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MjMwODc5MDg=","number":13474,"title":"ROI waypoints don't always work","user":{"login":"mwiatt","id":4399188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTkxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4399188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt","html_url":"https://github.com/mwiatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwiatt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1450324872,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDUwMzI0ODcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Communication%20(MAVLink)%20%F0%9F%93%A1","name":"Communication (MAVLink) 📡","color":"f66608","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2019-11-14T20:30:04Z","updated_at":"2020-08-16T13:55:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nOccasionally (maybe 50% of the time) an ROI waypoint will not be processed. This bug has been present since at least 1.8.2 (when I started using PX4). When I was using 1.8.2, I was using a PWM driven gimbal hooked to the AUX port. Now, I am using 1.10.0-rc1 and experiencing the same bug with a Mavlink connected gimbal. Completely different hardware,\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThis behavior is intermittent and hard to regularly reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1) Create mission with a \"ROI\" waypoint and possibly a \"Cancel ROI\"\r\n2) Upload to flight controller\r\n3) Take off and fly in mission mode.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe gimbal will point at the ROI waypoint. If a \"Cancel ROI\" waypoint is issued, the gimbal will return to a neutral position.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=566767d5-5d67-4d58-add6-fad66e1579d9\r\n\r\nFlight plan:\r\n[ROI.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3848510/ROI.txt)\r\n\r\nIn the flight above an ROI waypoint is added. Sometimes the gimbal will point at the ROI waypoint as it should. On some flights it wont. Attached to the last waypoint is a \"Cancel ROI\" waypoint which doesn't always cancel the ROI. Several flights were performed as well as several reboots of the AP. The results were an inconsistent mix of everything working to nothing.\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Tarot X6 (with Tarot retracts)\r\n- Pixhawk Cube 2.1\r\n- Here2 GNSS\r\n- PX4 1.10.1rc1\r\n- QGC 3.5.5\r\n- Gremsy S1 Gimbal connected to Telem2 (Mavlink)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI have verified the gimbal is working correctly. My MNT_MODE_IN is set to \"AUTO\" and I can always control the gimbal pointing angle via RC. The problem only occurs when a ROI waypoint is used to control the gimbal. I have verified that this behavior also exists when the MNT_MODE_IN is set to \"MAVLINK_ROI\".\r\n\r\nI am eager to do as many test flights as necessary to get this resolved. If additional logging is required, please provide instructions to enable logs. I am also willing and able to build new firmware.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13471","id":522867383,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MjI4NjczODM=","number":13471,"title":"v1.10.0-rc quadcopter doesn't take off in HITL/jMAVsim ","user":{"login":"langrind","id":11541631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxNjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind","html_url":"https://github.com/langrind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langrind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":552258139,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTIyNTgxMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/hitl","name":"hitl","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"hardware in the loop simulation"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2019-11-14T13:41:58Z","updated_at":"2019-11-17T10:19:40Z","closed_at":"2019-11-17T10:19:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nSet up HITL simulation with jMAVsim on Ubuntu 18.04,  Pixhawk 4 with v1.10.0-rc, locally built px4_fmu-v5-multicopter. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

the bug**\r\nI'm having an issue where my hexacopter will not disarm once the aircraft has landed. The aircraft was flown in Position flight mode (or Stabilize flight mode) and then changed to Land flight mode. The aircraft is able to successfully descend and touch the ground successfully. However, instead of disarming, the motors speed up, which results in the aircraft wanting to tip over and crash.\r\n\r\nI have looked on the internet and I have found that it is important to get the hover throttle percentage correct as well as  the manual minimum throttle percentage. I have adjusted these values but still no success. I also changed the parameter (COM_DISARM_LAND) to 0.1 seconds, but still no success.\r\n\r\nI know that there isn’t an issue with the actual aircraft as I have managed to successfully perform a mission using APM firmware, where it was able to land and disarm safely.\r\n\r\nIs this possibly an issue with the firmware or does someone perhaps know a solution to this problem?\r\n\r\nP.S. I have disabled the arming switch (changed parameter CBRK_IO_SAFETY from 0 to 22027)\r\n \r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Disable arming switch\r\n2. Change flight mode to Position or Stabilize\r\n3. Arm & takeoff to an altitude between (5 - 10 metres)\r\n4.

flying a drone in offboard mode, the drone will not take off unless it receives a vertical velocity less than -0.3 m/s.

And in most cases if you are regulating the drones acceleration, then drone will not take off, as the velocity updates will be too small.\r\n\r\nThe current work around is to just set your initial

the bug**\r\nLanding gear are enabled via a mixer to AUX1. Landing gear properly retract upon takeoff. When landing, the gear do not start to deploy until the copter is around 1m above the ground.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Power on and wait for GPS lock\r\n2. Uploaded mission. Mission End is set to \"Return to Launch\" [gear-test.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3786802/gear-test.txt)\r\n3. Took off in mission mode\r\n4. Verified during testing at two locations, 4 flights each.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nDuring the landing phase, landing gear should be commanded to deploy when RTL_DECEND_ALT, LAND_ALT_1, or LAND_ALT_2 is reached though I am not sure which it is (but would like to know). \r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nFlight Log showing a very quick flight with one waypoint:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=c57c04e0-a6bd-4f04-9fe2-eb986cbcc1b4\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Tarot X6 (with Tarot retracts)\r\n- Pixhawk Cube 2.1\r\n- Here2 GNSS\r\n- PX4 1.9.2\r\n- QGC 3.5.5\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nA file named lgear.aux.mix is placed in /fs/microsd/etc/mixers. This Tarot landing gear controller requires an PWM output of less than 1520 for the gear to retract and greater that 1520 for the gear to extend which is the reason for the (-) scaling. It has the following content:\r\n```\r\nM: 1\r\nS: 0 7 -10000 -10000 0 -10000 10000\r\n```\r\nA file named config.txt is placed in /fs/microsd/etc with the following content:\r\n```\r\nset MIXER_AUX lgear\r\nset PWM_AUX_OUT 1234\r\nset PWM_AUX_DISARMED 1500\r\nset PWM_AUX_MIN 1000\r\nset PWM_AUX_MAX 2000\r\nset PWM_AUX_RATE 50\r\n```\r\nThe gear are working properly in mission mode on takeoff as well as manual mode using an RC channel assigned by

the bug**\r\nUsing px4_sitl_default together with gazebo and sending set_actuator_control_target via pymavlink successfully establishes a mavlink connection and actuator commands are received on the px4 stack and uorb topic offboard_control_mode is published. When using the system console and sending `commander mode offboard` the stack freezes. No uorb topics are published and no mavlink messages are received (gazebo plugin correspondingly outputs `[Err] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:1155] poll timeout` in the mavlink poll function). The pxh system console remains responsive but commands to any module (e.g. commander, uorb) have no effect and hence indicating the system wide freeze. No error message from PX4 is shown and gdb debugger catches no signals.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- run `px4_sitl_default gazebo`\r\n- send mavlink messages via pymavlink `c.mav.set_actuator_control_target_send(0, 0, 0, 0, controls)`\r\n- switch to offboard mode using `commander mode offboard`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nPx4 was expected to switch `vehicle_control_mode` into offboard mode.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n- https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=86db944d-af82-456a-bb6c-79e8e5b223dd\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- PX4 firmware (v1.9.2)\r\n- mavlink (release/kinetic/mavlink/2019.10.10-1)\r\n- mavros (0.33.0)\r\n- Approaches so far:\r\n  - PX4_INFO() print outputs showed that commander reaches publishing in run() loop\r\n  - gdb info variables and inspecting last variables gave no further insights\r\n\r\nThe freeze presumably happens after the system console arguments are parsed and published in the commander run loop. It could also be that the crash happens earlier and all modules get stuck at the file descriptor polling. Maybe a problem from global variables causing a race condition with the main commander thread? Maybe I am missing something but it does not seem that variable access is coordinated when parsing the mode argument.\r\n\r\nAny advice on how to approach or debug this problem are very much appreciated!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13309/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13299","id":513377453,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzMzMTc2NDA5","number":13299,"title":"sensors: own BAT_V_DIV and BAT_A_PER_V params","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-10-28T15:26:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T20:03:09Z","closed_at":"2019-10-28T20:03:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/13299","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13299","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13299.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13299.patch","merged_at":"2019-10-28T20:03:06Z"},"body":" -

topic).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is pretty straightforward.  The uORB topic `optical_flow` includes a field `integration_timespan`, which is used within EKF2 (after being copied to the `dt` field of a `flowSample` object) for a number of calculations, including for the variable `flow_innov`.  The UAVCAN sensor driver for optical flow devices (HereFlow) did not copy this field to the topic before publishing (but it does exist in the CAN message frame).  This resulted in `flow_innov` always being 0.  The fix: copy the field (ensuring consistent units).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13257/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13252","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13252/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13252/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13252/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13252","id":511214945,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTEyMTQ5NDU=","number":13252,"title":"Throttle

the bug**\r\nAs reported by Michael as well on https://discuss.px4.io/t/pixhawk-2-px4-fd-fail-flight-termination-not-working/13281 the CBRK_FLIGHTTERM seems not to work.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. set CBRK_FLIGHTTERM to 0 to enable circuit breaker\r\n2. set one of the PWM_MAIN_FAIL to 2000us and connect e.g. servo to that PWM port.\r\n3. arm drone and take off\r\n4. force drone to exeed the max roll/pitch angle of the default 60° (FD_FAIL_P and FD_FAIL_R)\r\n5. motors DO NOT stop now and a programmed PWM_MAIN_FAIL is not set (servo not moving)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nangle of more than 60 degrees should be detected. Motors to be stopped and PWM_MAIN_FAIL settings to become active.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=58de9b83-0cf3-4e7f-9a0e-55df674bfdbf\r\n\r\nAdd screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3907200/67264491-7de11a00-f4ab-11e9-9c98-ef1a5ebd57f7.png)\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3907200/67264500-83d6fb00-f4ab-11e9-9aa8-f41c602c23b9.png)\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- LJI500S test drone with NXP FMUK66 revC\r\n- Red flash light connected to PWM6 port (flash light starts blinking at >1500us) to indicate status of PWM output.\r\n- CBRK_FLIGHTTERM set to 0\r\n- PWM_MAIN_DIS6 set to 900us\r\n- PWM_MAIN_FAIL6 set to 2000us\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTesting of the PWM_MAIN_FAIL6 settings was previously done by setting RC loss Failsave to \"Terminate\". With this configuration and by swithing off the RC transmitter motors were shut down and PWM_MAIN_FAIL6 set to 2000us got active. So the issue seems to be related to the CBRK_FLIGHTTERM (FD_FAIL_P and FD_FAIL_R) behaviour only.\r\n\r\nTest was executed without propellers! Drone was armed at ground floor and throttle value was set to 50%. Drone was carried up to 5th floor of building and flipped over (upside down).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13242","id":510302402,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzMwNzAwNjEw","number":13242,"title":"generate_listener.py
