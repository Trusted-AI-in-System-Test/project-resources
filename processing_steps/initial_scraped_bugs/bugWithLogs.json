The proposed solution is to only fuse a fake yaw measurement when the yaw variance of the estimator is too large (i.e.: larger than its initialization value).\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- do not run the mag selection/reset/fusion logic when the mag is inhibited\r\n- stop the mag fusion when the mag is constantly inhibited, this prevents having the mag fusion flag set while the fusion is not occurring for a long time.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL test: mag type none, takeoff in alt mode, move to init yaw. After a couple of seconds, change the gyro bias to 0.1 rad/s\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\nThe gyro bias takes time to estimate and during that time, the drone makes a violent toilet bowl spiral. It ends up stopping navigation and falls back to alt mode after 2 yaw resets.\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=9619a774-677a-43e3-96c7-6dc710d1828e\r\n![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20221229172559](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822839/209981336-b4934b10-fb4b-41fa-97a1-82944e3819eb.png)\r\n\r\nthis PR:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e8694d1e-8798-4734-89fb-fd7e663bdfd5\r\nThe gyro bias is learned rapidly and a slight toilet bowl is enough to correct the yaw estimate properly.\r\n![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20221229170529](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822839/209981905-c5c5cdc0-7109-42d3-aaf9-4b54d37d02a0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- unit tests for the mag inhibition\r\n\r\n",

  "title": "Broken Loiter: loitering at wrong position, erratic loiter direction",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/20477",
  "body": "## Describe the bug\r\nThe drone sometimes loiters around a wrong position and doesn't respect NAV_LOITER_RAD nor the desired turning direction.\r\n\r\nI've observed it regularly on SITL VTOLs, and I could also break it once on a SITL plane. On VTOLs it's always the first HOLD command after a transition in mission mode which fucks up. The drone either holds around Home or at next Waypoint, but not at current position as it's supposed to. Resuming mission and then triggering Hold again works fine. Even the Hold in MC mode is affected by this, if triggered after a back transition.\r\n\r\nOn a pure FW drone I don't know what it takes to break, but it's possible as well. I've had one occurrence where the drone flew to the next WP instead of Loitering at current position.\r\n\r\nAlso, if this happens, then the NAV_LOITER_RAD is ignored and the drone is just flying with max bank angle. \r\n\r\nThe bug is present in both v1.13 and current main.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol`\r\n2. Upload a mission containing a transition, e.g. the one here: \r\n[Zurich FT loiter bug.zip](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/files/9858850/Zurich.FT.loiter.bug.zip)\r\n3. Launch the mission. Trigger Hold at some point after the front transition.\r\n4. See error\r\n5. Feel free to resume mission, trigger Hold again, and observe that it works correctly again. Then resume mission, launch a back transition via QGC interface, and Hold again -> broken again.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe drone should loiter around the point where the HOLD command was sent.\r\n\r\n## Log Files and Screenshots\r\nLog on v1.13 (roughly, our fork contains some minor changes but nothing which affects this) where the drone more or less returns home for Loiter : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=f24d5c4e-b495-4d9b-93dc-b6e321beda15\r\n\r\nLog on upstream where I consistently managed to break the logic after transitioning, even after back transitions : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4e307d13-c94a-4543-a625-3e54d88ae0b9\r\n\r\nLog on upstream with tailsitter. Same behaviour as with standard VTOL: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=f1441279-1e2f-42e1-8599-b17ff4881f19\r\n\r\nLog on upstream on a FW plane where I managed once (on the second trigger) to break the logic, but not the first time nor any time after: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=683f7ffa-58c3-4860-ae32-debca6c1433e\r\n\r\nLog on upstream on a MC drone where I couldn't break it (not sure if nothing is broken for MC or if I just haven't found how to break it): https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d2fafa11-a5fa-4bed-a6ed-108749353267\r\n\r\nAdd screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n![position_controller_status type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48206725/197734350-158a8591-dcf8-42ae-8ea3-f3d4035fe66e.png)\r\nI've found so far that during the Loiter which goes badly the position_controller_status/type stays at 0 instead of being the usual 2.\r\n\r\n## Drone (please complete the following information):\r\nI haven't dared to check on a real drone yet.

  "title": "Navigator: fix init of _mission_item, plus add guards for using mision_item.loiter_radius",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/20464",
  "body": "\r\n## Describe problem solved by this pull request\r\nThis is to address what was reported here: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1277934841\r\n\r\nWhat I think was going on:\r\n- RTL triggered a couple of times, and each time it was above the return altitude, so didn’t have to climb. In the v1.13 RTL logic, as pointed out [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1284454859), the mission_item.loiter_radius field wasn't filled, and it just kept using it as initialized. \r\n- The initialization happens in the constructor, and it initializes it to `_navigator->get_loiter_radius()`, which itself just gets the value of `_param_nav_loiter_rad`. At this moment, the params are though not yet fetched (happens [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/c267cf71c3aa57fbbe544d02f3b25650f029384d/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L151))\r\n- in the [flight](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=4a466655-3c02-4f78-ab9e-1d90bca4b8e3) linked in the above mentioned issue , the initialisation value of it seems to have been 3.9e32, which was then passed through to the `position_setpoint_current.loiter_radius` (there is only a check for if(>0)), and the vehicle started on it's voyage around the solar system\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/197223431-d4a5a3c5-33ee-4655-8974-32d73cfc8abb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe your solution\r\nOn current main we by accident fixed this particular issue already,[ as we explicitly set the loiter_radius](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/ed558e199faab703ea3fb352db16512981fdb7ec/src/modules/navigator/rtl.cpp#L407) in every state of the RTL state machine. This wasn't the case in v1.13, but I guess we should back port it.\r\nAdditionally we should change the initialization of mission_item. I propose here to initialize to 0, which is considered as \"invalid\" before and not used in then (checks for ISFINITE and >FLT_EPS). \r\nI did the same for mission_item.acceptance_radius. \r\n\r\n## Describe possible alternatives\r\n- do we have a way to update the params before the constructor is called?\r\n- should we initialize `mission_item` fields consistently to NAN instead of some to NAN (currently yaw, lat, lon), and some to 0, and some not at all (e.g. altitude). And is this initialization in the constructor even needed?\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n(Presumably this is user error and not a real bug, but I was asked to create an issue so I'll try to follow the template.)\r\n\r\nThe aircraft tracks the planned path quite well until approximately when it exits the landing loiter for the final approach. At this point, it seems to make a turn to the right and then land on this new path.\r\n\r\nI would like to understand why this occurs and ideally how I can correct it.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSee logs below. We're flying entirely in mission mode (with the exception of noted aborted landings).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected the plane to track the planned landing direction, heading on a path towards the landing waypoint.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n\r\nOriginal example: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=eea3a1e0-be68-470d-98ab-3730bf357679\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1906581/140832721-156a392e-96fd-4bf6-b152-4d1b7b5644b3.png)\r\nThe divergence can be seen quite clearly in the above PX4 screenshot.\r\nFlight plan: [nov3-flight3.plan.txt](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/files/7500669/nov3-flight3.plan.txt)\r\n\r\nLooking at the yaw angle plot for this one, it looks to me like the plane is lagging behind the set point consistently until suddenly the set point is updated to approximately the current estimated yaw. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1906581/140833088-c69982b5-ab96-45bd-9f82-d939b51459c9.png)\r\n\r\nAnother example from this morning: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=63428e7b-2bd6-490b-9d14-e347effb02a4\r\nThis one I had `FW_LND_HHDIST` set to 0.\r\nThere are two landing attempts on this one. The first showed the same behavior of veering off to the right and was going to miss our landing area entirely, so I switched to position control mode and we put it up in a hold. We uploaded a new plan with the landing pattern shifted significantly to the west and let it land on that one. Probably easier to decipher what's happening on the first log.\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\nX-UAV Talon (the 1.7 m wingspan one -- not the mini or pro)\r\nAutopilot hardware is a Pixhawk 4 mini with the GPS puck and a Lidar Lite v3.\r\nMounting of GPS puck and autopilot are as shown below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1906581/140833310-7a93007f-05cf-4e58-97a0-d8f6eb77593e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1906581/140833427-8a173f63-d96b-4eac-98cc-b4bfb9695d7c.png)\r\n(You can ignore the extra wires in the second picture - they were for some ground testing.)\r\n\r\nBoth are oriented in their normal direction.\r\n\r\nI haven't done any tuning for this platform. I'm just flying it on the X-UAV Mini Talon profile, which seems to be plenty good enough to get it to fly, however I think it's quite clear from the logs that some of the control loops could be better tuned.",

This can lead to unexpected deviations during back transitions. And as the altitude is ultimately controlled (fix) by the MC module the spiralling down doesn't actually spiral down anyway... Also note that if you have a small value on FW_CLMBOUT_DIFF you can be affected even when the next WP is at the same altitude if the drone gets a lot of altitude during back transition due to pitching up.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nDeactivate the loitering logic during transitions. \r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n\\-\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nFound on two different real quadplanes, and I was able to reproduce it on SITL.\r\n\r\nReal flight on v1.12.1: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=2f6a1c96-eabb-4576-abb1-a99b716f6c67\r\n\r\nSITL tests with attached mission file [test BT deviations.zip](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/files/7279541/test.BT.deviations.zip):\r\n\r\nmaster, FW_AIRSPD_TRIM = 19, FW_L1_PERIOD = 25 and NAV_LOITER_RAD = 50: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=79cadeb1-27bc-4c4c-88c4-7ded26c0a430\r\n\r\nmaster, default parameters: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6c1b368b-a435-4868-a856-159d68da926c\r\nInterestingly there is no deviation even though the logic still triggers.

On magnetometer raw data and gyro data plots there are very clear time ranges, when actual rotation happens, but yaw plot demonstrates drift outside of them. Also yaw check bit is 1 in estimator watchdog.\r\n\r\nIt isn't a hardware issue, because when we switch back to 1.13 firmware we get good results: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d4f79fd4-1623-43ad-baa6-bd748f4a1e2e.\r\n\r\nWe have also recorded log on 1.12 with SENS_BOARD_ROT=0 to check if this relates to problem, still getting drift: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=3760a163-3aa2-48f0-84f5-afdacd6dd3b4.",

  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18035",
  "body": "**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nFor fixedwings, there were different flap scalings deployed between auto modes and manual flight modes, resulting in the flaps always being deployed halfway in manual flight modes.\r\n\r\n- In manual flight modes(stabilized, manual), zero flap input was mapped to flap command 0.5\r\n- In auto modes(mission, hold), zero flap command was mapped to flap command 0.0\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThis PR removes the special scaling in manual flight modes, so that the flap does not get deployed when switching fixed wing aircraft between manual and auto modes.\r\n\r\nThis should not influence flaps being deployed in auto modes.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nBy removing the scaling, we are assuming that flap commands range from [-1, 1]. This makes more sense since the mixers actually allow you to give -1 flap commands. If we want to prevent this behavior, IMO we need to add an explicit mode for it rather than secretly scaling this inside the attitude controller.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nTested by flying a plane model in Gazebo SITL\r\n```\r\nmake px4_sitl gazebo_plane\r\n```\r\nFlown using a virtual joystick on QGroundControl.

Log here: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=26c65922-793b-4bad-88fa-86f58b97eb82 . For some reason Param2 of the command is set to 3, triggering the Quadchute instead of doing a normal back transition during RTL. I was able to reproduce in SITL on v1.12.0-beta and on master. I guess the issue is a badly initialized / old value of param2 floating around somewhere.\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=efaae0f0-a8a8-494c-b32d-6e041689836f\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e177614d-a4c1-4ebf-97ca-6ed6fb8cf420\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nExplicitly set Param2 to 0.0f in all occurrences where a normal BT is desired (I searched for all occurrences of *DO_VTOL_TRANSITION in the code).\r\n\r\nI also added a check on NANs.

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWe are using a Pixhawk Holybro V4 for a multicopter setup. It seems that the platform restarts mid-air which causes the vehicle to crash (Motors stop and the Pixhawk reboots immediately). These test flights are done in a MoCap environment and we are using the internal EKF2 by feeding the MoCap pose at 30Hz via the mavlink vision pose topic. Each individual flight produces 3 logfiles:\r\n\r\n- First file: Short ~4 second period\r\n- Second file: The longer flight period with the notification of a software error\r\n- Third file: A short ~4 second period again\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the smaller logfiles before and after the flight test but I attached them anyway.

  "body": "**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nPreviously, rover vehicles were not able to handle Takeoff waypoints. The behavior when a takeoff waypoint was passed to a rover vehicle was:\r\n- The vehicle would not move since the waypoint was too close\r\n- The takeoff waypoint would not get accepted since rovers are not able to climb and reach the altitude\r\n\r\nI think it might be obvious that one \"should not\" pass takeoff waypoints to a vehicle. However, QGroundControl only lets you plan a mission that starts with a takeoff waypoint. While this should also be an improvement on the QGC side, I think it is still useful to handle this case on the vehicle side so that the vehicle can still progress with the mission even with a takeoff waypoint\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThis adds a special case when handling takeoff waypoints for rover vehicles. The acceptance radius is set to only consider horizontal distance to the waypoint, if the vehicle type is rover.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\n- This was tested in SITL gazebo, with the rover model.\r\n```\r\nmake px4_sitl gazebo_rover\r\n```\r\nThis log shows a full mission successfully finished starting with a Takeoff waypoint and finished with a RTL: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=25fe983b-44d0-4a11-a7c2-2ab9662c35d4\r\n",

  "title": "Unexpected mode switch from OFFBOARD mode",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16235",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nIt has been reported by several users that while flying in offboard the Pixhawk randomly changes to a different mode for no apparent reason, i.e. not due to offboard control failure, or sensor failure etc. Usually this change is extremely fast and the reason for is not registered in the flight logs making this issue quite hard to debug. In our case this mode change coincided with the mode that was set in the Pilot RC at the time, in this case ACRO, though @bperseghetti reported haaving the same issue in the past and it even happened without an RC on which seems to indicate it is not an RC issue. He also mentioned that this mode switch seemed random but it's still to be verified. @ThomasRigi also reported facing the same issue more than once and one time also in the kill switch.\r\n\r\nThis issue was discussed in PX4 Dev call on November 18th 2020: https://discuss.px4.io/t/px4-dev-call-november-18-2020/19554\r\n\r\nIt was first raised in slack here: https://px4.slack.com/archives/C0W2KUFFT/p1605613677266600\r\n\r\nSo far it has been reported on V1.09 and V1.10. No instances on V1.11 but most likely it's just from lack of usage. \r\n\r\nAll the logs will be provided further below.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUnfortunately this issue seems super hard to reproduce as it does happen quite rarely (@bperseghetti put it in the range of happening once every 150/200 flights). But the steps are to simply fly offboard often and for large periods of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe UAV should NOT exit offboard mode for no apparent reason, and while there are many reasons that could explain this mode change, for our current architecture the UAV would have changed into HOLD mode given our parameters, or in more extreme situations it could switch into either POSITION, ALTITUDE, or as a last resort into STABILIZED.\r\n\r\nA secondary issue is that even if the UAV is indeed changing modes, that should be explicitly recorded in the logs which is currently not happening as it seems that since it's such a quick change it goes in between the two log points.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n\r\n**Log 1** \r\nUAV changed from OFFBOARD mode to ACRO.

I'm not sure if you have any logs that you could share?\r\n\r\n**Possible Solutions/Changes**\r\nThese Solutions/Changes were discussed on the Dev Call when this was first raised.\r\n\r\n1. Add some hysteresis or more simply a timeout for the mode change. It really shouldn't matter for most of the user base if the mode change takes 50-100ms extra vs being basically instant. For the small use cases where this can be a concern perhaps this could be disabled via a parameter or even the precise timout period could be defined there.\r\n\r\n2. Throw an INFO message on mode change. If possible with the reason for mode change. It doesn't really solve this issue but it would help gather data to solve it in a different way in the future. IMO it also makes sense that this is enabled anyway.\r\n\r\n3. Change the message logging structure to ensure that no relevant data escapes the log in the presence of such a glitch.\r\n\r\n4. ???\r\n\r\nFYI @ThomasRigi @bperseghetti @dagar @MaEtUgR \r\n\r\nMany thansk in advance.\r\n\r\nP.s. @dagar We would especially like to ask if a fix regarding 1. could be fast tracked as there is a good chance that we are blocked from flying atleast we implement a solution, even if temporary. So this is quite high priority/critical from our side. Of course whatever help that you need just let me know and we'll help out in any way I can but I would assume it would just be changed in commander. If you do not have the bandwidth let me know and I can try to get a PR for you to review but in that case any pointers that you can provide would be helpful.",

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n[Flight 1](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=70d80c6c-46f4-4d45-a710-bcc0ed0cae1c)\r\nAfter ~30s of full manual indoor flight (~5m height above floor), the estimated attitude began to drift significantly in the roll angle (even in pitch, but not so much), even though the pose desired by the pilot was the hover state. The pilot tried to compensate by tilting the drone in the opposite direction, however, he reached the limit position of the roll stick on the RC and the roll still continued to drift. The high velocity led to a rough crash into a wooden bench. There was no RC signal loss and we checked that the RC had no trims and subtrims in effect.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time we experienced this behavior after ~4 years working with PX4 firmware.\r\n\r\n[Flight 2](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=5dc3d4bb-5c16-4ec6-b7ad-17f2456e4f3b)\r\nThe second incident we had was the next day on the same location with different hardware, but the same symptoms. After ~30s of manual flight in altitude mode (~5m height above floor) the UAV started tilting uncontrollably and then crashed into a wall. Again no RC signal losses, no trims and subtrims. We were even flying with this platform the same day in the morning for ~10 minutes without any issues [(OK Flight)](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=e0c02122-4335-4ce3-ab3d-598a38e98c7f).\r\n\r\nPlease find attached logs and description of the hardware in the following sections. My colleague will also upload a video which compares the PX4 estimated attitude with the correctly estimated attitude obtained from a custom attitude estimator run on the recorded IMU flight data.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of this behavior? Could there be a bug in the attitude estimator that only manifests in some highly specific conditions? Is there some problem apparent from the logs that we are missing?\r\n\r\nPlease ask for any relevant additional information that could help solving the issue. Until we resolve this issue we cannot fly indoor in this setup, because it is too unreliable and dangerous.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nWe tried to reproduce the behavior in lower height above floor with another drone with the same setup as in the first flight without success. \r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n[Flight 1](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=70d80c6c-46f4-4d45-a710-bcc0ed0cae1c)\r\n[Flight 2](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=5dc3d4bb-5c16-4ec6-b7ad-17f2456e4f3b)\r\n[OK Flight](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=e0c02122-4335-4ce3-ab3d-598a38e98c7f)\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n***Flight 1***\r\n- Frame: Quadrotor Tarot T650\r\n- Total mass: 3.5 kg\r\n- Motors: Tarot 4114-11 320KV\r\n- ESCs: BL-Heli 32 50A\r\n- FCU: Pixhawk 4 (PX4 FW v1.10.1)\r\n   - attached to the frame by screws\r\n- RC: Hi-Tec Flash 8\r\n- RC receiver: Optima SL\r\n\r\n***Flight 2***\r\n- Frame: Custom coaxial octarotor\r\n- Total mass: 5.5 kg\r\n- Motors: T-Motor MT2814-11 710KV\r\n- ESCs: FOXY Multi 30A Opto V2015\r\n- FCU: Pixhawk 2.1 Cube (PX4 FW v1.10.1)\r\n   - attached to the frame by foam dampeners\r\n- RC: Hi-Tec Aurora 9\r\n- RC receiver: Optima SL\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- Magnetometer fusion was turned off for both flights\r\n- All components were used previously in many flights\r\n- Calibration of accelerometers, gyroscopes and level horizon was done the day before the first incident",

  "title": "[VTOL] Adaptive Quadchute is broken",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14947",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nThe \"loss of altitude\" quadchute only triggers when it's already too late. \r\n\r\nThe problem seems to lie with the non-documented hard-coded conditions on TECS height rate which take too long to be set to true: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/6c16a29d26b2c79d63f1459be361c8972399d9ce/src/modules/vtol_att_control/vtol_type.cpp#L246-L249\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI only tested with gazebo_standard_vtol, v1.11.0-beta2.\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nVersion 1: (worst I found, quadchute has no possibility to recover the drone)\r\n1. Disable the elevator in the sdf file, e.g. by setting [the area of the elevator](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/blob/4acd679d17a735a1f62781349d14289a29b01014/models/standard_vtol/standard_vtol.sdf#L732) to 0 (you could also comment out the whole elevator block)\r\n2. `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol`\r\n3. Make sure VT_FW_ALT_ERR is set accordingly (in my logs 15m)\r\n4. Launch a mission (or something else) that makes the drone transition to FW\r\n5. In FW mode the drone will tip over and lose altitude\r\n6. Observe how late the the quadchute is triggered\r\n\r\nVersion 2: (not as extremely late, drone still crashed though after quadchute)\r\n1. Have the gazebo_standard_vtol model fly a normal mission with FW flight\r\n2. Make sure VT_FW_ALT_ERR is set accordingly (in my logs 15m)\r\n3. Disable the pusher motor (via motor failure plugin)\r\n4. Watch the drone lose altitude and eventually trigger the quadchute (still late, but not as late as with Version 1)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nQuadchute should activate as soon as you have lost VT_FW_ALT_ERR meters of altitude with respect to the altitude setpoint. I understand the idea behind also checking if the drone is falling to not trigger in situations where for example you ask for a steep climb that the drone can't immediately react to, but the current implementation clearly doesn't work well if it only triggers when the drone is falling out of the sky with more than 20m/s vertical speed with already more than 25m of altitude lost.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nVersion 1, disabled elevator: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5e45b915-3e91-4156-9d14-956cbffbc73e\r\n\r\nVersion 2, disabled pusher motor: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=b3cf09c8-9b47-4832-98bf-b453ebd7cfa2\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Gazebo standard VTOL\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n(Part of) the reason why it triggers so late with Version 1 is that TECS first still needs to initialise after the front transition, but the drone is already dropping. It takes way too long until TECS actually asks for +1m/s height rate\r\n\r\n@sfuhrer @RomanBapst I think some thoughts should be spent on how to best set the trigger logic.",

  "title": "Poor Fixed wing runway takeoff tracking ",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14851",
  "body": "Fixed wing runway takeoff tracking is very poor on various firmwares and aircraft types that i've been testing and had others test.\r\n\r\nI've compiled some notes and logs on this and it was even brought up (in a different context) in https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/11785 but the more we look at it, the more this is a true issue and from a practical standpoint is making using autonomous takeoff not feasible given the high risk.\r\n\r\nLet me also preface this by saying a many things have been tested and changed and a makeshift solution was come up with as well but that doesn't solve the problem. Wheel Rate settings have been altered to various extreme and subdued amounts (as seen in the logs). This has reduced some things present like sudden full wheel deflection upon mission start but it never fixes the trajectory of the takeoff and that it does not generally point or aim to the takeoff waypoint but goes off course many time more than it does not.\r\n\r\nMultiple different aircraft and aircraft types were used, even though the mixer is the same, that is only because we have varying sizes and weights of test aircraft and even foam ones where the setup, weight and geometry on the nose gear and linkages is completely different (which is good to rule out a single hardware type or build as the culprit).\r\n\r\nI often have seen the wheel channel output (main 5) swing up and down 500us over neutral, essentially max on both extremes and even when that isnt having the same type of behavior exists at +/200. The scaling factor probably helps in these cases by reducing movement (so long as you are still on course enough or at least not going to crash on takeoff) but the thing to remember is this entire process is only 3-8 seconds long before you're airborne so it's easy to not see or overlook.\r\n\r\nThe hacked solution? Limit min/max pwm value of the wheel servo either in PX4 or at the servo level to limit how much steering can physically occur. This is not a solution but gets things airborne by quasi limiting the ability to go off course. Not a true solution.\r\n\r\nLogs:\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=efad594a-afe0-451a-a1dd-a6130e49a03b\r\nThis log has an sudden full right wheel right as the mission is initiated.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"815\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-06 at 4 09 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31726584/81230497-38072180-8fb7-11ea-9942-27b46c07db99.png\">\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=25ce0df8-15d6-4591-8578-83042921cffe - This is similar but not as severe as the previous log (still has huge wheel swings though).\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=53e17faa-3f52-4a3f-8e7e-b2d8c8ede219 - This log is interesting that the aircraft was purposely moved to the corner of the runway because the previous flights had it going to the right during the takeoff portion and it sill went much too hard right and then off the runway.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"825\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-06 at 4 35 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31726584/81230726-a1873000-8fb7-11ea-846f-1522b97372cc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=ee6bef2c-167c-4d43-ae96-8ac2144df2e1 - This takes off successfully because of the large area, thats the only reason.

But I found the issue is independent of that pr.\r\n\r\nThe thrust doesn't ramp nicely anymore like it was designed but depending on stick input can go up and down unexpectedly during the ramp up. This can lead to early land detection if the thrust goes up high enough and then back down because the ramp is not yet high enough.\r\n\r\nThe problem is: Because the takeoff ramp is a vertical velocity limit ramp for the nice user experience but the acceleration feed-forward can add on top of the output and depending on trajectory generation result in unwanted thrust changes during the ramp.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nI suppress the vertical acceleration feed-forward during the ramp.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nIt's reproducable in SITL with the correct configuration:\r\n`MPC_TKO_RAMP_T` 5, `MPC_JERK_MAX` 20\r\n1.

  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14735",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWe are flying in indoor environments with VIO, and while testing recently, discovered that the EKF's velocity estimate significantly differed from that provided by the vision system. We don't know if this is a new issue, or whether this already existed before, since we have not flown this setup so extensively before. We also only recently plumbed the vision system's velocity estimate through to PX4, so it's easy to confirm the issue now.\r\n\r\n*EDIT: older logs (~1 mo old - upstream `d7a9b123e6b84df4a7c01daaac64706c39abd3d7`) don't show this velocity offset, and have lower vibration levels. I think the on-sensor DLPF was disabled between then and now.* https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=ff62827a-7eff-45c6-b2e6-6ea22cd087c6\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5557676/80012224-f8aae200-849a-11ea-8594-8472c7f0853b.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe velocity estimate matches the one provided by the vision system, which is accurate and has been benchmarked against groundtruth. Also the vehicle was flying in a straight line, and that velocity offset wasn't actually there in real life.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nHere are two logs from boot illustrating the issue. The first one is without velocity fusion enabled, and the second one is with velocity fusion enabled (which doesn't make much of a difference).\r\n\r\n1.

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nHi, I found very strange GPS behavior after uploaded \"v1.11.0-beta1\" to pixhawk 4. Firstly, I configured MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2 (My UAV has been flown using this config. before since firmware v1.8.2, v1.9.2 and v1.10.2 and I got no error). Then, I investigated using\"mavlink inspector\" in QGC and take a look at GPS_RAW_INT. \r\n\r\nGPS signal seems unstable, the fluctuation ranges from 0 to 5 Hz. It should be a constant value or nearly constant (compared with an older firmware, I have already tested before).\r\n\r\nFinally, the result is the flight mode could not be changed from ALTITUDE to POSITION, No Green GPS LED light visible. I managed the test as follows \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce / Test Case**\r\nCase 1: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = Disabled\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=9764baca-ec06-40aa-b1ba-79719d0b75fc\r\n\r\nCase 2: v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=a670c429-592e-4e52-a200-b811bd45f14d\r\n\r\nCase 3: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM/SERIAL4 \r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=98b8c1ec-d492-48b5-823a-870af29e5686\r\n\r\nCase 4:  v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning\r\nMAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM2  \r\n\r\nCase 5: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK\r\nMAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM/SERIAL4 \r\n\r\nCase 6: v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning\r\nMAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM/SERIAL4 \r\nMAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM2  \r\n\r\nCase 7: v1.10.1 --> OK (compare to Case 2 v1.11.0-beta1.

According to the flight log of Case 2, you will see the strange GPS behavior at \"GPS Uncertainty and GPS Noise & Jamming\". In every test case, Telemetry works fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, GPS works fine if I upload the older firmware \"v1.10.1\" (v1.8.2 / v1.9.2 is the same) Is it firmware bug ? or Did I miss anything?\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Describe the type of drone: Tiltrotor using E-flite Convergence airframe\r\n- Hardware: Pixhawk4 + GPS pixhawk 4 + Holybro telemetry\r\n\r\n",

  "title": "EKF2 estimates for x and y unstable with constant optical flow innovation ",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14165",
  "body": "Hey everyone,\r\nfirst of all shoutout for your great work, it's really impressive.\r\n\r\nRemark: In hindsight I've written quite a long story here, but I hope providing what I figured out help digging into the problem faster.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working with the Intel Aero RTF drone with the PX4 v1.9.0 firmware. I'm trying to fly indoors (hence no GPS) with ORB-SLAM2. This basically works already, fusing the data to the EKF2 via /mavros/vision_pose/pose. However, I experienced undesired behavior if SLAM fails (e.g. when it looses track after fast motions). I thought it should be possible to still get decent state estimates using only internal sensors, PX4Flow, and the LeddarOne distance sensor (the sonar on the PX4Flow board is still active but not used. Also I'm sharing the Telemetry port for PX4flow and LeddarOne as suggested here https://github.com/intel-aero/meta-intel-aero/issues/315#issuecomment-391439235).\r\n\r\nSo I did some experiments without SLAM running, and dragging around the drone by hand only for safety. Indeed, the position and velocity estimates are quite ok for multiple minutes (note that I put down the drone from time to time to observe the integration drifts). But at some point x and y drift off devastatingly and need to be resetted by the EKF2 all the time. I'm not sure why this happens. All I found out (using fw_px4_plottools) is that the optical flow innovations just freeze at some point and that's exactly the timestamp when everything gets messy. I'm not sure whether that's the cause or just another effect though. Note that also lifting the drone to a height where optical flow values should be plausible didn't make it recover anymore.\r\n\r\nThe z position / velocity do not seem to be affected. However, I noticed an issue there as well, although I personally can't see any connection: there are non-zero z-velocities (up to 0.4m/s), even when the drone is standing still and the z position is constant. Thinking of their kinematic relationship, that doesn't really make sense. Looking at some plots one could think they behave the same way, i.e. z velocity is just a scaled version of z position (which would explain why it's static and then it'd only be a bug in the log). Also looking at different static phases, the z positions are not necessarily equal (although the floor is the same). I saw that the LeddarOne tends to output 0 when the drone is on the floor, so I tried to fix this by forcing EKF2_MIN_RNG to 0.0m, but it didn't do the trick.\r\n\r\nHere are two logs where the drone is dragged around and xy goes nuts after some minutes.\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=91bc8ed4-6044-45e8-bfcf-5416976ad011\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=907f8a65-388e-40ad-83d9-3bdee61bc29c\r\n\r\nHere's one log where I actually flew around with the RC using POSITION flight mode. Note how here first OF innovations go constant and simultaneoulsy xy drift off. But then when SLAM is fed xy recovers. However, apparently I lost SLAM at some point during flight and the drone skyrocketed to the left (as far as I can tell at a faster rate than I thought MPC_XY_VEL_MAX would allow).\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=af47b24a-1a44-4eee-898d-7f9a72c8412b\r\n\r\nHere are also 2 screenshots to show the main problem without the need of opening any logs, i.e. drifting xy position (and velocity) and constant optical flow innovations:\r\n![constant_flow_innovation_xy_drift](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46818571/74592643-77ab1680-5023-11ea-9731-9bb9127b42fa.png)\r\n\r\nThe third case makes clear why I want to make sure, a scenario without SLAM would lead to a safe landing at least. Hopefully some more experienced people can have a look at this and we find out whether it's my setup, some parameters, or the EKF2 (for the latter I assume @priseborough to be the ideal contact person). I'm of course happy to provide more info on my setup if needed.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDominik\r\n",

  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13697",
  "body": "There is some bad system behavior we've observed in legacy firmware (between v1.8-v1.9) related to airspeed data disappearing, for example if the I2C bus flakes out or if power is lost to the airspeed sensor.\r\n\r\nI submit this for review against the new airspeed selector work @sfuhrer and others are contributing in hopes the new airspeed features will robustly handle these difference cases.\r\n\r\nIf airspeed data suddenly disappears there are several bad behaviors:\r\n\r\n1. The system seems to keep sending the last known airspeed reading down the MAVlink pipe to the ground station (might need to be verified).  It should instead stop sending airspeed data if no new data is available.\r\n\r\n2. There are no warnings to the user that airspeed data has gone missing. There should be some warning inidcation if airspeed data is expected but disappeared.  There should also be an indication if it returns.  (note: similar data disappeared, data returned indications should be extended to all sensor types).\r\n\r\n3. On a failed takeoff, if the autopilot stops receiving airspeed data, the LandDetector may think the vehicle is still flying because the last reported airspeed still seems to be piping into the system. The motor may still run at full throttle! Ideally airpseed would stop updating and \"zero\" or \"null\" would be reported and the system would understand that it should not be using airspeed as part of the LandDetector.\r\n\r\n4. If airspeed disappears during flight there is no indication that it disappeared. TECS will silently switch to non-airspeed mode and not tell the user and by-passes the airspeed failsafe functionality. There should be warning indications and the airspeed failsafe functionality should be followed.\r\n\r\nHere are some flight logs showing the last example of airspeed data disappearing during the middle of a flight:\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=d378dac5-1061-444d-ba8d-ee911c6315cf\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=35be23c2-6bdf-4caa-9075-f9805b6d2035\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=5ffc7018-9793-4b88-89a3-8066988b1e54\r\n\r\nFYI @sfuhrer ",

  "body": "This is an attempt to fix an issue which can seen in this [log file](https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=47b2b562-bd40-4137-ae46-ef34d17d5f21)\r\nWhat happens is that the VTOL starts to descend after the back-transition prior to arriving at the actual waypoint. This can be very dangerous e.g. when the vehicle is pushed away from the land waypoint during the transition. It will then start to descend while moving toward the land waypoint.\r\nThe behavior should be that the vehicle keeps altitude until it has reached the landing waypoint.\r\n\r\nI have first reproduced this behavior on 1.9.2 but it only happened once in a while and appeared to be a race condition. I figured out that in some cases the navigator was using the acceptance radius from the fixed wing position controller in order to determine if the landing waypoint has been reached. This is a bug as the fixed wing acceptance radius can be very large and should not be used during hover.\r\nI believe this fix here solves the issue on 1.9.2.\r\n\r\nHowever, when testing the same fix on master I figured that there is a new problem in master.\r\nFor some reason the altitude setpoint of the position_setpoint_triplet.current is set to a very low value (6m) right at the start of the back-transition. This value is then further used as altitude setpoint during the horizonal movement during the landing waypoint. I'm not sure what causes this but the effect is again that the vehicle descends while moving towards the land waypoint. This needs further investigation.\r\n\r\nThis can easily be reproduced in SITL using the standard vtol model.\r\nI'm further uploading the mission file which can be used to reproduce the problem. You might need to change the file extension to .plan\r\n[vtol_mission.LOG](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3932587/vtol_mission.LOG)\r\n\r\n",

Start SITL, wait for GPS\r\n2. Switch mode to HOLD, arm, then disarm without taking off\r\n3. Arm and takeoff in POSCTL\r\n4. Switch to RTL. This is when the spike to 0 usually happens. It might not based on timing and it might only be visible in a log.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe thrust should not go to 0 even if navigator takes a while to figure out what to do.

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nUsing px4_sitl_default together with gazebo and sending set_actuator_control_target via pymavlink successfully establishes a mavlink connection and actuator commands are received on the px4 stack and uorb topic offboard_control_mode is published. When using the system console and sending `commander mode offboard` the stack freezes. No uorb topics are published and no mavlink messages are received (gazebo plugin correspondingly outputs `[Err] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:1155] poll timeout` in the mavlink poll function). The pxh system console remains responsive but commands to any module (e.g. commander, uorb) have no effect and hence indicating the system wide freeze. No error message from PX4 is shown and gdb debugger catches no signals.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- run `px4_sitl_default gazebo`\r\n- send mavlink messages via pymavlink `c.mav.set_actuator_control_target_send(0, 0, 0, 0, controls)`\r\n- switch to offboard mode using `commander mode offboard`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nPx4 was expected to switch `vehicle_control_mode` into offboard mode.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n- https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=86db944d-af82-456a-bb6c-79e8e5b223dd\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- PX4 firmware (v1.9.2)\r\n- mavlink (release/kinetic/mavlink/2019.10.10-1)\r\n- mavros (0.33.0)\r\n- Approaches so far:\r\n  - PX4_INFO() print outputs showed that commander reaches publishing in run() loop\r\n  - gdb info variables and inspecting last variables gave no further insights\r\n\r\nThe freeze presumably happens after the system console arguments are parsed and published in the commander run loop. It could also be that the crash happens earlier and all modules get stuck at the file descriptor polling. Maybe a problem from global variables causing a race condition with the main commander thread? Maybe I am missing something but it does not seem that variable access is coordinated when parsing the mode argument.\r\n\r\nAny advice on how to approach or debug this problem are very much appreciated!",

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\nThe following points don't work as they should upon triggering a GPS Failsafe on a VTOL drone in FW (flying in an AUTO mode):\n1) The drone doesn't do the fixed bank loiter upon a GPS Failsafe. Instead, it pretty much continues to fly in whatever pose it happened to be upon triggering. \n2) Also, the landing doesn't seem to work. In SITL it just keeps flying.\n3) Recovering the GPS signal doesn't work properly.\n4) It \"randomly\" falls back to the previous flight mode after some time (after it should have initiated landing)\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Start SITL with `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol`\n1. Set the NAV_GPSF_* parameters to some non-zero value\n1. Launch a mission or just loiter in FW\n1. Trigger the failsafe by disabling the GPS signal: `gpssim stop`\n1. The drone will not be doing the fixed bank loiter properly\n1. Enable the GPS driver again: `gpssim start`\n1. The drone will not (directly) recover its global position even though on QGC you can see its exact position\n1. Wait\n1. The drone will not initiate landing (even though navigator says Terminate)\n1. At some point the drone will switch back to what it was doing before (Mission or Loiter)\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe drone should do the fixed bank loiter as a FW plane and upon recovery of its global position continue its mission or whatever it was doing before.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nSITL, v1.9 : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5befa577-0ade-4c90-b82c-045830915138\nSITL, current master : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=ac15492a-04b5-4e27-851e-cdb00cb27d62\n\nReal flight, v1.9 : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7c1a4be9-8e6b-41e2-b7fa-dd29cd270795\n\n* our pilot took over after 7s, but clearly the fixed bank angle didn't work.\n![bokeh!UNITO-UNDERSCORE!plot(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48206725/63368099-7d2de980-c37d-11e9-8b3b-44fddc5429c9.png)\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\n\n* SITL : standard VTOL quadplane\n* Real drone : standard VTOL, running v1.9 on a Cube\n\n**Additional context**\nI tested the Failsafe on the Gazebo plane and it works as it should. I also tested the Failsafe on SITL VTOL in MC and it's good too.\n\nInsights on the root cause of the failsafe on the real drone would be very welcome too :) I can't quite pin down what caused the velocity and position innovations to diverge suddenly.\nI know that the vibrations and the magnetic interference could have been part of the issue, but we have over 10h of flight time with the same setup (or even more vibrations) on v1.8.2 where to my knowledge it never occurred and another 5h on v1.9 (with two triggers so far)\n\n",

  "body": "I’m trying to get arm authorization working and running into some issues. First here’s my setup:\n\n- Pixhawk Cube\n- Authorizer is a Linux board running pymavlink using v2 dialect\n- Param COM_ARM_AUTH = 1280001 (require one arm, 5s timeout, authorizer sysid 1)\n- Param COM_ARM_MIS_REQ = 2 (require auth but not valid mission)\n- Arming via Qground\n\nI can go into more detail on the setup if needed, but all the basics appear to be working. When arming I see the COMMAND_LONG 3001 arrive in the python script, and I have even rebuilt PX4 for the Cube to check that the COMMAND_ACKs I send to it are being received in the mavlink module. Here is the behavior I observe:\n\n- After reboot of Cube, the first arming attempt fails. It appears to fail even before the first COMMAND_ACK (with result MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS) reaches the arm_auth module via uORB\n- Subsequent arming attempts succeed, but they appear to rely on acks that are still queued from the first attempt. I have tested killing the python script after the first arming attempt (fail) and the second attempt still succeeds, despite no new acks being sent.\n\nHere is a snippet showing what the python script does:\n```\nin_msg = self._mav_sock.recv_match(blocking=False)\n  if in_msg != None:\n    if in_msg.get_type() == ‘COMMAND_LONG’:\n      self._mav.command_ack_send(3001, 5, 255, 5, 1, 1) # in progress\n      self._mav.command_ack_send(3001, 0, 255, 5, 1, 1) # arm cmd, accept\n```\n\nA log probably isn't that helpful in this scenario but here it is anyway:\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=bb57f1ee-6991-4190-b62b-6d2bdc7d013d\n\nHere's the nsh listener output showing that auth fails before my acks arrive (on this run I rebuilt PX4 with extra debug messages):\n[arm_auth_debug_fail_on_first_auth_attempt_txt.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3495153/arm_auth_debug_fail_on_first_auth_attempt_txt.txt)\n\nPlease let me know what additional info would help.\n\nThis was also posted on the forum here: https://discuss.px4.io/t/arm-authorization/12383",

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\nWe did 4 flight tests on Tuesday, the first two logged fine, the last two stopped logging during fight. The other parts of the system were working as usual so I didn't even notice anything until reading the logs and finding out most of it is missing.\nI am logging everything at the highest rates so I am not surprised by the frequent dropouts, but why did it just go off completely? \n\nNow I am trying to increase the buffer size by multiplying it in line 283. [https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/36534d5bab3d6a73f146e671df1b8f40772174b7/src/modules/logger/logger.cpp#L283](http://url)\nMultiplying it by 4 makes the dropouts less frequent but sometimes the buffer still saturates. If I try to multiply it by 5 the logger won't start at all. Why there is a limit? \nThe stack size seems unaffected but I try to increase it to 5000 anyway, making no difference.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI would expect the logging to resume after the buffer clears up, not just to stop completely.\nAlso maybe the way to increase the buffer correctly is not completely clear to me.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nHere the logging stopped even before takeoff. There is 10+ minutes of flight missing.\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=0fd05bfa-c092-49f5-8cf6-c89c3d950f51\n\nThis is the last flight, there should be another 5+ minutes tracked.\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=fdb9b50f-cc70-48d0-92d1-04215f50c64c\n\n**System**\nPixhawk 4\n\n",

However, rather than following the setpoints (usually defined in local coordinates) it simply flies straight. \r\n\r\nThis seems to be because the fixed wing position controller blindly reads from the setpoints in global coordinates from the position_setpoint_triplets.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L854-L855\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1.

I updated the latest px4 firmware 1.9.2 through QGC. The pixhawk is fmu-v2, I use a companion compute board insatlled ros kinetic and mavros. And I'm trying to do offboard control indoor with vicon device.\r\n2. As the  screenshot shows, I publish the vicon data to the mavros/vision_pose/pose topic, and the left window shows the data with commander line: rostopic echo mavros/vision_pose/pose, the middle window shows the data with commander line: rostopic echo mavros/local_position/pose, and the right window is the QGC analyzer, and the three sets of position data is consistent. So I think I set the EKF2 parameters in QGC right based on this \r\n3. After I keep publishing data through the topic mavros/vision_pose/pose and run the script which continues to publish the waypoint to the topic /mavros/setpoint_position/local, I can change the drone to the offboard mode by using QGC,  when the drone is in offboard mode, it just takes off and seems not be able to reach the fixed point and hover, which should be the position (0,0,0.5) as I set in my code,  it just drifted away in one direction, and seems to rise up constantly. I also tried the code here, https://github.com/mzahana/px4_indoor_navigation/blob/master/scripts/px4_offbaord_test.py\r\nand it has the same results and can not hold position. I tuned the yaw rate controller PID, roll and pitch controller PID and they are fine. But I don't know whether this is a firmware issue or I need to tune the position controller PID. \r\n",

Before this crash flight, I encontered\nThis time when plane is in mission, reached the 5th waypoint, the plane didn't continue mission, however, it continued to fly towards the 5th point, the flight path is like a \"8\", then all the command from QGC became useless, still I can see all the plane status (attitude/vel/pos...).

Prepare the plane with RC, upload the mission, then plug out the sd card before manually take-off. Fly the plane, then switch to mission mode, the plane would fly to the only known point, the flght path is an \"8\".\n1. In HIL with rotory wing (can't use fw hil), make the rw excecuting mission, then plug out the sd card, the rw would stop at the moment it reaches the current waypoint and stop there. Made several tests, seems that MAVLINK_MISSION and NAVIGATOR modules stopped. COMMANDER module works normally. Switching mode in QGC is useless, mavlink console is dead. RTL is also useless. Only RC can truely switch the mode to manual/altitude/position. \nI checked code, I doubt it's a datamanager problem, maybe one semaphore is blocked...

  "body": "**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**\r\nTo be able to still infer the direction of the thrust vector we limit it to a minimal length even if `MPC_THR_MIN` is set to zero. The parameter `MPC_THR_MIN` already needs to be forced to 0 so this is really an extreme corner case.\r\n\r\nNote: This is a hotfix for certain specific applications. The direction of the thrust vector in this corner case is very likely to get into the tilt limit which is generally undesired.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nSITL tests:\r\n- **Without** a tiny minimal thrust added in this PR flying unsmoothed position control with `MPC_THR_MIN` set to 0 and demanding a downwards step which results in hard downwards acceleration:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4ef6a4cf-359e-4561-adbb-5a93387a981e\r\nthrust goes to (0,0,0) attitude roll and pitch go to level.\r\n![without](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/57354740-931bf380-716c-11e9-9843-40bc3ef41749.PNG)\r\n\r\n- **With** a tiny minimal thrust added in this PR flying unsmoothed position control with `MPC_THR_MIN` set to 0 and demanding a downwards step:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=58cae91c-5896-45ea-8e12-b45551d28250\r\nThe thrust keeps a minimum length and hence roll and pitch can still be infered.\r\n![with](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/57357162-9a460000-7172-11e9-8c29-6c8c9348ac54.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe your preferred solution**\r\nIt's desirable to keep the attitude information in the thrust vector and therefore it should never be exactly (0,0,0).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nA remaining problem that existed before is that if e.g. to accelerate downwards very hard the thrust vector in z-axis direction gets zero (which means demanded idle thrust and hence almost freefall) the desired attitude should not tilt extremely just because the result of the velocity control is 90 degree tilt in the direction of the horizontal error.\r\n\r\nI disucussed with @bresch that it would makes sense to at least not demand the direction of the thrust vector to change faster than the maximal rate to rate controller will execute in the end. Otherwise we know beforehands it will result in a large unfeasible error.\r\n",

The problem seems somewhat intermittent, but we can go for stretches of hours where it will do it on every boot. \n\nLogs of the event show that it receives input_rc messages every 3-20 seconds, with  SOURCE=RC_INPUT_SOURCE_MAVLINK and 8 channels of 65535 values. When looking at the scaled manual control inputs in the log viewer, that gives an almost full yaw command and zero throttle, which may be the source of the arming.\n\n\nWe also have ensured that the RC_IN lines while not connected to an RC transmitter are not floating electrically. \n\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Unplug RC receiver, and remove props!\n2. Power on aircraft \n3. Wait\n4. Sometimes it will arm and takeoff.\n\n(Note that in our case we have the CBRK_IO_SAFETY set so that is NOT necessary to press the safety switch before launch), otherwise the arm would be prevented.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nWe expect the aircraft to sit there and never arm\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nBecause the system arms, it starts logging. here are some logs from the events. It is worth noting that the input_rc message in the logs show a few received values, even though there are no  RC receivers connected, and the source is listed as MAVLINK.\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4abb3756-1202-4d7f-93df-7278dcec0897\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d12666c6-faed-4645-bc04-0d5a94d05116\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=508c3766-012d-4a24-a538-80235388be71\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=2f046532-ae41-4327-b683-57cdfe3e1d70\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7cd79b51-c6b8-4ee0-9b33-311ef4f6c0ae\n\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\nOur  system is based on a custom adapter board with a Pixhawk 2.1 cube on it, a wifi module, and a long range radio.

I am using fmu-v3 (master) with a small alteration to make the Lidar boot before the PX4FLOW (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/11009).\n\nFrom the logs I see that my local position estimates vary wildly at the beginning until I get the error and, after that, the estimating stops (obviously). However, the condition_local_position_valid flag drops to zero even before EKF stops navigation and it never goes back to one. Here is an example of a short test I did this morning:\n\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=95d3f262-f3ef-4dea-9398-91dcce53d245\n\nI was flying outdoors and neither take-off nor landing were exactly smooth. I thought it might be an issue with the PX4FLOW, but I have tried both indoors and outdoors flights on floors with different textures and the quality data I get seems to be good enough. Also, even though the acceleration power spectral density data is not ideal, I get much better values indoors and yet I still get the same error, so I doubt vibration is an issue.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

This seems to have started in master this past spring and continues in stable 1.8.0.  I believe a lot of other PX4 users are getting these false positive warnings as well.\n\n- (Note: in recent master the text of this warning as changed to \"Preflight Fail: High Accelerometer Bias\")\n\nThis happens to us frequently on known good aircraft that are great fliers and continue to fly great once the fault is cleared. \n\nWe recently noticed the error seems correlated to a vehicle sitting level on the ground for some period of time.  @priseborough made a helpful suggestion to try pitching and rolling the vehicle slowly so that the X and Y accels could spend some time facing down (gravity) and EKF2 could better estimate their bias.  This worked to clear the error!  Here is an example of the error which was then easily cleared by pitching and rolling the vehicle:\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=278fa376-2a02-4027-b465-12507dbc9062\n\n**Possible solution:**\nIt has been suggested that using the bias state uncertainty as a factor in the bias level check could help eliminate false positives.  The bias level check in Commander could use the already existing additional information from EKF2 for this.\n\n\n**Further support:**\n\nAnecdotally I know of this exact ACCEL BIAS warning happening to handfuls of other PX4 users, many of whom do not post to Github or Discuss.\n\nThere are a large number of github issues and PX4Discuss posts about getting this error.  Probably there are many complicating factors involved with each report, but the fact that there are so many makes me believe there is a systemic issue with the check, or the checks and warnings need to be more specific.\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/9241\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/9474\nhttp://discuss.px4.io/t/preflight-fail/7023/10\nhttp://discuss.px4.io/t/ekf2-problem-z-velocity-estimate-weird-behaviour/8395\nhttp://discuss.px4.io/t/auto-land-ekf2-test-ratios-flight-controller-reset/8264",

As I am hovering, sometimes the bird yaws hard and loses altitude. I think the fact I lose altitude indicates to me that we don't have enough thrust to push through the decent caused by spooling down half of the motors in the yaw.\n\nWhile I have been digging through the logs, I noticed a point where the yaw setpoint jump sharply at 7:36. I also noticed a baro EKF error and would that case an EKF reset on the mags which could cause a sharp heading change?\n\nI feel like this might just be a poor calibration and tune but I thought I would ping you to see if you have any great ideas.\n\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=ca81fd27-ac49-4d8f-aac2-da9e1532396d",

  "body": "We just had a series of flights with marginally stable position control performance (toilet bowling). Analysis of the logs showed that the mag measurements (external HMC5983, internal mags disabled) are not changing one bit. This was only fixed by power cycling the vehicle, rebooting the FC did not change anything.\n\nThere are two problems with this incident:\n1) The mag malfunctioned. Has anybody seen something like this before?\n2) More importantly: Why was this not detected by the flight controller? Should this data not be marked stale / timed out and arming in position controlled modes/switching to these modes refused?\n\nIn addition to the mag measurements being constant, EKF2's heading innovations (configured to heading only fusion) are constant, i.e. no mag measurements are fused. This makes sense considering that the mag measurements are old (`sensor_combined_0.magnetometer_timestamp_relative + sensor_combined_0.timestamp` is constant). But the heading / position estimate is not marked invalid by EKF2.\n\nOur firmware is based on 1.7.4.\n\nHere is a log file: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=8f1505e6-f998-47e4-9693-58c3c0424774\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

  "title": "Navigator: Fix fixed-wing first order altitude hold",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9850",
  "body": "**Issue**\r\nNavigator's fixed-wing first-order altitude hold (FOH) is currently causing altitude reference oscillations when in any LOITER mode. See screenshot below. Not only altitude, but also pitch and throttle can thus oscillate significantly. We observed this during a recent test flight.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2565608/42387985-53c6343e-8144-11e8-86d2-a42aecc4c5c0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLog file from SITL where this can be seen: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=f18c45ab-622e-4b1d-9819-03cfb06af2b5 . Here, after t=3:20 the true altitude setpoint is still the same as before t=2:20 (i.e. 630m AMSL) but the FOH logic just wrongly sets it to 660m and adds slight oscillations on top. The exact amount of oscillations depends on waypoint distance, altitude difference etc, but i have seen altitude ref oscillations of up to 30m, resulting in full pitch up/down of the aircraft.\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\nSee the commit for the location of the code where this is happening. Essentially, every time that the loiter radius of any loiter WP is larger than the acceptance radius calculated from the L1 turn distance, then the Navigator FOH would _not_ consider the waypoint reached and would thus not stop modifying the current altitude setpoint. This leads to the oscillations or offsets in the altitude reference. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nIf in any loiter mode, consider the loiter radius times a factor of 1.2 (same as for the waypoint_reached logic [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L217) as the acceptance radius. Tested in SITL, which should be sufficient for this case.\r\n\r\n@acfloria @ryanjAA @antiheavy FYI\r\n@dagar Made this PR as a quick hotfix independently of your PR at https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/8883/files which supposedly also fixes this but is much larger and where it is more uncertain when this would be merged.",

  "title": "2 hard faults (on ground + in air) with PX4FW v1.7.4",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9348",
  "body": "## Bug Report\nWe (ASL/ETHZ) have recently had two hard faults that caused Pixhawk to reboot. One of them unfortunately happened in air with a 3.2m wingspan fixed-wing, one happened during on-ground testing.\n\n## Setup\n - Hardware: mRo Pixhawk (px4fmu-v3 / 2MB flash)\n - Firmware: Basically PX4FW v1.7.4, i.e. master-branch from 5 days ago (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/71170dce0a87ce06e00d721a713dfc3dc92dfc11) but with some slight modifications mainly to adapt the mixers to our platform and one custom sensor driver. The estimator is EKF2, the flight controller is the stock controller.\n\n## Hard fault 1: In-air\nWe had done 3 short MANUAL flights before that, and in this flight first flew manual for about three minutes and then switched to stabilized. The hard fault ocured 1 minute after switching to stabilized mode. The pilot continued to fly in PX4IO's (important!) manual override mode, and, as he barely noticed the issues, actually went back into stabilized mode for some time before then landing the plane following our instructions. The ulogger-log of part 1 (see below) stops in air. We could not find any fancy stuff in the logs before the log stops. Pixhawk rebooted in-air, and continued logging as usual (part2, see below).\n\n- Log files (with attached hard fault log) from take-off to in-air hardfault and pixhawk reboot: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=3b702655-6052-46e6-85e2-fd012d27c25f\n- Log file after the crash (i.e. after the pixhawk reboot until landing): https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=409fcb62-50ca-42d1-82c7-f1bcaccfe9fd\n- Telemetry logs:[2018-04-20 15-13-09.log](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934640/2018-04-20.15-13-09.log) (rename to .tlog!). The reboot happens after ca 1/3 of the log file length, you can see that it happened because the relative altitude is suddently zero or even negative.\n\n## Hard fault 2: On-ground\nThis happened during in-lab testing. We performed extensive pre-flight checks, including rebooting FMU (by pressing the reset button) and checking that IO's manual override still works. It did, but (and i assume this is normal because there is already a mixer present) loading the mixer after that provoked reboot fails. We let the plane then just sit there for a couple of minutes, and suddenly Pixhawk rebooted. This was a hard fault, too. We unfortunately assumed this was BECAUSE we had provoked the in-air restart via pushing the FMU reset button (and after testing for another 8 hours in-lab without any hard fault assumed everything was OK). I don't have the ulog-files yet, but i have:\n\n- The hardfault log from the SD card (it looks very similar to the one we saw in flight): \n[fault_2000_01_01_18_53_35.log](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934634/fault_2000_01_01_18_53_35.log)\n- The console output. Note again that this log starts after we provoked an FMU reset via pushing its reset button, that's why it is an in-air restart. \n[consoleLog.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934645/consoleLog.txt)\n\nI might be able to provide the firmware .elf file to allow debugging the hard fault as described in https://dev.px4.io/en/debug/gdb_debugging.html#debugging-hard-faults-in-nuttx if required.\n\nI guess it makes sense to add this to https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/9271 @RomanBapst @LorenzMeier ?",

Today, we successfully reproduced it in a Gazebo simulation. It seems that we are capable of arming and taking off in offboard mode without any position (GPS or PX4Flow). Therefore, our commands (vx, vy, vz yaw_rate)  are ignored except vz.\n\nThe takeoff procedure is the following:\n- OFFBOARD\n- ARM\n- (Vx=0, Vy=0, Vz=3.0, yaw_rate=0) until a certain altitude.\n\nWhen the simulation is started from a certain time, it works perfectly (well straight takeoff) but when the simulation is just started, we can still go in offboard, arm and takeoff but additionally to the expected drift, the copter rotates to north (the gazebo simulation starts pointing east)\n\n- **Log**: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5477f120-408d-4ce5-82e1-3b3d695a3a03\n- **Expected behaviour**:\n  * The copter does not arm until GPS fix or PX4Flow fix\n  * If the copter arms, it should drift as the position is not fixed\n- **Behaviour**:\n  * The copter arms\n  * The copter drifts\n  * **The copter rotates around the yaw angle** \n\n- **Steps to reproduce the problem**:\n  * Start Mavros over UDP link\n    * roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=\"udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557\"`\n  * Prepare your OFFBOARD control method\n  * Start the simulation \n    * `make -j8 posix_sitl_default gazebo`\n  * Run your OFFBOARD control method\n\n- Results:\n  * The copter arms, but rotates from East to North and drifts until we see in the console of the simulator: \"EKF GPS checks passed (WGS-84 origin set)\" and \"EKF commencing GPS fusion\". \n  * The rest of the mission works fine.\n\n- Simulation console information:\n\n```\nINFO  [mavlink] partner IP: 127.0.0.1\nWARN  [mavlink] [timesync] Hard setting offset.\nINFO  [lib__ecl] EKF aligned, (pressure height, IMU buf: 15, OBS buf: 14)\nINFO  [tone_alarm] positive\nINFO  [tone_alarm] positive\nINFO  [tone_alarm] arming\nINFO  [commander] Takeoff detected\nINFO  [tone_alarm] positive\nINFO  [lib__ecl] EKF GPS checks passed (WGS-84 origin set)\nINFO  [lib__ecl] EKF commencing GPS fusion\n```\n\n* **Hardware in simulation**: IRIS+\n* **Firmware**: \n  * PX4 1.6.5\n  * PX4 1.7.3\n\n* **CURRENT WORKAROUND:**\n  * Subscribe to `~setpoint_raw/local` topic (`handle_position_target_local_ned` Mavlink Handler) and do not approve takeoff before the topic is published. \n  * Once published, an additional (optional?) step is to verify that the position (x,y,z,yaw) in the `TARGET_LOCAL` message is **very close to** the current `LOCAL_POSITION`.\n  * Takeoff safely",

  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8672",
  "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI think we found a bug in the Position / Mission modes for vtol.\r\nTrying to fix the #8655 we made the VT_B_TRANS_DUR from 3 sec to 5 sec. And with the VT_B_TRANS_RAMP set to 3 sec. the ramp up of the quad motors to the \"commanded thrust\" happens in the middle of the transition and the throttle stays at that level up to the end of the transition, then it pasees the throttle to the MC. \r\n\r\nIn our case In Position mode the hover throttle is at 0.6 for the MC. So it is logical that the ramp up of the quad in the back transition go from 0 to hover throttle in order to hold the MC at current altitude (the idea behind Position mode) and continue like this up to the end of transition then pass the throttle to the MC to continue in Position mode until it stops.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for the back transition ramp up commanded throttle PX4 uses VT_TRANS_THR which is the throttle for the front transition pusher motor. \r\n\r\nYou can see it clearly in:\r\n\r\nMission\r\n![mission back tr thrust comanded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12617619/34905059-dbb58ea4-f859-11e7-8af5-8b617b05eb57.png)\r\n\r\nLOG: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e6381c08-4b42-41f2-a01b-bd9f7f0bbb58\r\n\r\nPosition\r\n![position back tr thrust comanded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12617619/34905110-f9bab6ee-f85a-11e7-93a4-b2d198cb38dc.png)\r\n\r\nLOG: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=66fa60a2-e7b4-487e-b916-3c45f024daf3\r\n\r\nWe could not see this up to now because we had a 3 sec back transition with 3 sec ramp up and with pretty low VT_TRANS_THR = 0.7 .\r\nNow because we fight the fron transition ramp up problem #8664 we made the VT_TRANS_THR = 0.9 and found out that during the back transition in Mission and Position modes the quad trhottle during the transition is so high that the VTOL just gains some 10-15 meters og height during the transition. It holds horizontal level but climbs drastically during the transition and then drops suddenly to hover throttle once in MC.\r\n\r\nIn Mission and Position modes neither the front transition ramp up neither the back transition ramp up are such to allow a smooth transition. at given altitude.",

Reported by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8400\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a bug causing the  height in the mavlink global position relative_alt message to be AMSL instead of height above takeoff location if GPS checks pass after takeoff.\r\n\r\nThe practice of allowing use of hold and position change commands via GCS inputs after a non-GPS takeoff has wider implications. In such a scenario, both RTL and geofencing are disabled, the user may not be aware of this, and unlike flying using stick inputs, it would be easy for the user to inadvertently fly the vehicle to a range where comms are lost or recovery using stick demands is impossible. \r\n\r\nThis has been tested in SITL using the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1) Modify the SITL startup script to inhibit GPS lock by adding 'gpssim set -t 0' at the end\r\n2) Run 'make posix_sitl_default gazebo' and wait for the ekf to initialise\r\n3) Select 'altitud'e mode on QGC, arm and takeoff using throttle stick\r\n4) Enable GPS lock using 'gpssim set -t 3'\r\n5) Wait for EKF GPS fusion to start\r\n6) Select 'hold' mode on QGC and command a positive altitude change using the slider and confirm completion\r\n7) Command a position change on QGC using the 'fly to click' feature and confirm completion\r\n8) Command a negative altitude change using the slider and confirm completion\r\n9) Command  a landing at current location.\r\n\r\nLog file here: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=afea809a-e7fe-463c-bfe7-ef6296064330",

PX4 ver 1.6.5 stable.\r\n\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6daee88d-90d7-4cbe-abb7-440591fef87d\r\n\r\nI think I found the reason but it is very strange and I need conformation. This is due to a BUG if I'm correct so please can you take a look and confirm the reason.\r\n\r\nThe pilot is not novice, it is pretty experienced one in terms of piloting a plane, but somehow sometimes the PX4 is overwhelming for him especially in certain situation and he is doing irrational switching (as many PX4 users might do).\r\n\r\nThis is the case:\r\n\r\nHe flew in Position and went in to Loiter (Pause). Then at some point he wanted to gain altitude while in Pause mode. In the graph it is obvious he started pitching up. But nothing happened as it should be, the plain continued to control the speed and throttle in the Loiter, despite the throttle lever was at 60%.  In the latest implementation the Pause button will get the plane in Loiter from any mode. So initially he was in Position mode with activated Position switch. Absolutely normal operation as it is meant to be. Then strangely enough he switched to Manual in the attempt to gain altitude, without turning off the Pause button. The plane continued to circle, but strangely enough transferred the full control of the Throttle to the lever of the RC instead of controlling the throttle in the loiter itself automatically. At the same time the pilot continued to pitch up and gained altitude and I see it clearly in the graphics.. Because he had the lever at 60% throttle it was not enough to sustain the loiter, so the plane started stalling, but still trying to continue to sustain the loiter radius and gain altitude in the condition of under throttle. Because of the stalls the plane was rather going in spirals toward the pilot, and he explained that he thought it is drifting still not realizing what is going on. He did not realize that the Throttle is in his control. Then at the last stall the plane just plunged in nose dive. Because we have a hard limit of 45deg for the pitch, the plane did not have any altitude and time to recover. \r\n\r\nI did not see any mechanical failure, neither to the servos neither to the GPS nor the airspeed sensor nor anything else.\r\n\r\nPlease can you confirm this and if it is a BUG it should be corrected. \r\n\r\nPause should be totally Auto mode, probably allowed to have some small amount of pitch control in order to gain or loose altitude, but in no case we have to give the throttle a manual control at this moment.\r\n",

This causes an interaction with the commander failsafe resulting in unpredictable transitions in and out of the failsafe mode. The solution implemented by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/39134325740a193fd755763e52faffe030073e5f\r\n\r\n- Checks for loss of navigation for up to 30 seconds after takeoff or until  a horizontal speed of 5 m/s has been achieved.\r\n- If the vehicle is not landed and the check is active, then the navigation is declared as failed if the velocity innovations fail for a continuous period of 1 second.\r\n- This will cause the local and global position and velocity validity to be latched false to prevent unsafe use of position control modes.\r\n- An emergency message 'CRITICAL NAVIGATION FAILURE - CHECK SENSOR CALIBRATION' is output to console and mavlink if the failsafe is activated.\r\n\r\nTest log generated using SITL with  90 degree misaligned compass data here: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6aa3a650-a65a-499a-a4ed-9ab287e9e764",

  "body": "**Bug Report**\r\n\r\nI file this as a bug report since I'm concerned that my crash today may have other reasons than accidentally flipping the Kill Switch. \r\n\r\nI was performing some tests to eliminate a strong Oszillation when braking in PosCTL. This was improving, when I wanted to do another Test, shortly after Taking of the Rotors stopped in Mid-Air and the Vehicle crashed on the road where Motors where spinning again. While hitting the Ground the Battery got disconnected (as can be seen in the Telemetry log). \r\n\r\nSadly the ULG stops shortly after start so about 2meters of flight are missing from the Vehicles Log (this is kind of strange). Also the OSD did not record anything since it claimed that there was no Communication (this may also be a bug of the OSD FW but it said that there was no data for more than 400 secs, which usually does not happen). \r\n\r\nSo I'm stuck with the Telemetry Log.

The Kill-Switch was engaged and disengaged under **0.5 sec and this twice in sequence**. I checked with my Remote and it is almost impossible to really push the switch to the position in-between where it may flip back in this quick manner. I'm not aware that I flipped the Switch and the Telemetry RC Input (Channel 6) does not reflect any change in Signal. I performed many flights, and never flipped the switch unintentionally.\r\n\r\nTelemetry Log (Check last 15 secs) : [2017-11-09 18-05-27.tlog.zip](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1458838/2017-11-09.18-05-27.tlog.zip)\r\n\r\nULog Upload : https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=1452c840-3003-4913-b528-1fff3f17d447",

  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8240",
  "body": "This PR addresses massive position setpoint overshoot caused by `_vel_sp_prev` windup. The bug is critical for offboard mode usage.\r\n\r\nFlying in offboard mode we had constantly observed position setpoint overshoots in case of flight to distant setpoint. E.g., here we are flying back and forth in offboard mode: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=61a675f6-020a-462f-b1cf-b58974460d44. Overshoots really stand out:\r\n\r\n![Overshoots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32437968-ff23a816-c2f9-11e7-8745-67fef6ea073d.png)\r\n\r\nHere is plot of y, vy and corresponding setpoints for 1000 m flight in offboard in SITL on current master (https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=92b7ba3c-e2f7-4094-98a3-05e8b5a8493f):\r\n\r\n![master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32437865-b5007b24-c2f9-11e7-9580-2f456f57f81b.png)\r\n\r\nAs can be seen on the plot, copter have overshooted setpoint for over 60 m because velocity setpoint started to drop from max forward velocity when copter already was 50 m ahead of setpoint.\r\n\r\nAfter debugging of mc_pos_control_main.cpp it became clear that cause of overshoots is windup of `_vel_sp_prev(0)` and `(1)`. The reason is [this fragment](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/aa699cf4b7e63d9bf17dc2ba2b95e2e02224a6ab/src/modules/mc_pos_control/mc_pos_control_main.cpp#L2455) of `calculate_velocity_setpoint()`: \r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (!_control_mode.flag_control_auto_enabled) {\r\n\tvel_sp_slewrate(dt);\r\n}\r\n\r\n_vel_sp_prev = _vel_sp;\r\n\r\n/* ... */\r\n\r\n/* make sure velocity setpoint is constrained in all directions (xyz) */\r\nfloat vel_norm_xy = sqrtf(_vel_sp(0) * _vel_sp(0) + _vel_sp(1) * _vel_sp(1));\r\n\r\nif (vel_norm_xy > _vel_max_xy) {\r\n\t_vel_sp(0) = _vel_sp(0) * _vel_max_xy / vel_norm_xy;\r\n\t_vel_sp(1) = _vel_sp(1) * _vel_max_xy / vel_norm_xy;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo `vel_sp_slewrate()` never see constrained velocity and `_vel_sp_prev` continues to rise to hunders and thousands m/s. When copter approaches the setpoint, `_vel_sp_prev` drops, but it's change rate is limited by `vel_sp_slewrate()`. Because of this windup `_vel_sp` can't begin to lower at time and vehicle overshoots. Overshoots are negligible in AUTO mode because mc_pos_control moves position setpoint so it is always close to the vehicle.\r\n\r\nIt would be more correct to address this moving `_vel_sp_prev = _vel_sp` to the end of control cycle, but this change causes incorrect behavior of smooth takeoff limiter so I had to move velocity constraining before `_vel_sp_prev` assignment, leaving smooth takeoff limit after it.\r\n\r\nThis is the same 1000 m flight in SITL after fix (https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d5bd2519-432c-446a-b8c9-fd021c2fdab6):\r\n\r\n![fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32439298-21fcc03e-c2ff-11e7-963c-92051e217d9e.png)\r\n\r\n@MaEtUgR, @Stifael, please review.",

  "body": "We were flying 1.6.3 for some time. But recently decided to reset all the parameters with the new defaults. For this we use change of air-frame procedure. So we carefully introduced our PIDs on top of the new defaults. We removed the circuit breaker for the airspeed and thus it did not ask us to calibrate the airspeed so the diff press cal params were empty 0.00. \r\n\r\nIn this setup we were not able to complete the transition. It never stopped the quad despite the speed got exceeding 20 m/s and the transition continued forever up to the crash.\r\n\r\nhttp://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=b6653ab1-ada7-4711-abaf-00a6a51249dc\r\n\r\nBecause we flew the 1.6.3 airspeed-less without a problem we just started thinking. We enabled the airspeed. Calibrated the airpseed. Then again we disconnected it from the breaker.\r\n\r\nOn the Bench test perfect transitions.\r\n\r\nhttp://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=619b0b6b-ae84-4220-aa52-73ddce2b7fcc\r\n\r\nhttp://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=3647be91-b6f2-4be1-a5a3-f66ca93c8b94\r\n\r\nAlso we flew without airspeed without any problem. So the only thing we had to do was to calibrate the airspeed in order to make the transition in aispeed-less config.\r\n\r\nDuring this tests we discovered another thing. In airspeed-less mode the only way we could manage the transition is timing. \r\n\r\nThere is a parameter VT_F_TR_OL_TM which is supposed to guarantee fixed transition time without airspeed. But in reality in airspeed-less mode the transition is done now by the VT_TRANS_MIN_TM which is the minimum front transition time. The VT_F_TR_OL_TM did not have any effect over the transition timing.",

Somehow during to transition IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF became equal to 0. (it is perhaps some minor bug in the transition between versions). However, it seems that it is not the only problem. \r\nDuring the experiments we found that FW pitch_rate controller with PR_FW_FF = 0 and PR_FF_I = 0 is not equal to its proportional gain.

Or if it is something intentional than what is added to FW control besides usual FF, P and I components? How can we control (and understand) this addition?

  "title": "Airspeed spikes cause FW to lose altitude",

  "body": "@sfuhrer @RomanBapst porting the [slack conversation](https://px4.slack.com/archives/C0W2KUFFT/p1626796170295800) here.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nSometimes, out of nowhere the `tecs_status.airspeed_filtered` message shows a huge spike that is enough to mess up the whole TECS algorithm. The drone loses a lot of altitude really fast. So far this has only been observed in SITL, and only rare occasions during relatively long flights.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI was unable to reproduce it reliably. On the occurrences where it happened, it was with SITL gazebo_standard_vtol on long distance missions (>30km). Restarting the simulator and running the exact same mission works most of the time (until you hit the bug again). It would be a good idea to increase the logging speed of all airspeed related topics.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThis should not happen.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nFirst occurrence: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4b21aeea-5784-46b6-8e42-964fecc7c20a\r\n![image(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48206725/128736463-2eddc542-4eb0-4538-a7b6-83964c68ae26.png)\r\n\r\nSecond occurrence: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5acff421-3ff4-4bf2-bd5d-bb4a7222f241\r\n![image(3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48206725/128736474-71a00d4f-4cf5-4002-844e-02479e4aba58.png)\r\n\r\nOn the first occurrence, only the TECS TAS topic showed the spike, making it difficult to tell where it originated. On the second occurrence, it is also logged on the airspeed validator, but still not on the initial airspeed topic. So the source of the issue is either inside the airspeed validator module or with the (simulated) airspeed sensor.\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- SITL, Gazebo Standard VTOL\r\n- v1.11 based\r\n\r\n**Potential Solutions**\r\n- find the source of the airspeed spike and eliminate it. Either in the airspeed validator (@sfuhrer) or in the simulated airspeed sensor (@Jaeyoung-Lim, maybe you would have an idea?)\r\n- As @RomanBapst proposed in the slack conversation, change the filter that is applied to the airspeed in TECS so that a single spike doesn't have that much influence. Could also help in further reducing noise coming from the airspeed sensor. Examples could be a median filter or similar types (LULU)\r\n\r\nI think changing the filter is something that would be worth doing anyway, to protect against an erroneous signal on a real airspeed sensor\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCopy of the slack thread so that it doesn't get lost in the future: Thomas Stauber  20 days ago\r\nWe've just observed a very weird behaviour in a simulation which I'm not sure if it's SITL related or if it could happen on a real flight - if it could it'd be pretty bad with a fixed-wing hitting the ground like a missile. (SITL running an v1.11-based branch)\r\nBasically the simulated VTOL was flying nicely in FW for a good amount of time when suddenly the tecs_status.airspeed_filtered message diverged to 2e8 m/s, causing the drone to cut throttle. Then tecs_status.airspeed_filtered became a constant 3 (no decimals), triggering first TECS_MODE_BAD_DESCENT  and then a few seconds later TECS_MODE_UNDERSPEED . The drone pitched down with almost full thrust and triggered an adaptive quadchute for loss of altitude.\r\nI really don't understand where the 2e8 m/s spike and the constant 3 m/s of airspeed_filtered comes from.\r\nAlso, the RTL that followed the quadchute was not working correctly for the first ca 30s where the drone kept losing altitude instead of climbing at desired RTL altitude.\r\nLog: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4b21aeea-5784-46b6-8e42-964fecc7c20a (flight review seems down, I hope I copied the correct link)\r\nThis file can’t be shown because your workspace has passed the free plan’s 5 GB storage limit. See paid plans\r\n\r\nLorenz Meier  20 days ago\r\nSilvan Fuhrer Could you comment on that?\r\n\r\nRoman Bapst  19 days ago\r\nSilvan Fuhrer Let's check that one. Actually I'm thinking we should probably add a median filter to airspeed data somewhere. A spike with that magnitude can easily cause the complementary filter in TECS to fill up to an insane value within only one iteration.\r\n:+1:\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nSilvan Fuhrer  17 days ago\r\nWell the airspeed data isn't the issue here. Must be something numerical related to the accel data? local_position/az jumps at the same time as tecs_status/airspeed_filtered.\r\nI'd say we somehow limit the effect that accel data can have on airspeed_filtered, and trust more the airspeed data (whose validity we check with the airspeed validator)\r\nThis file can’t be shown because your workspace has passed the free plan’s 5 GB storage limit. See paid plans\r\n\r\nThomas Stauber  17 days ago\r\nAre you sure the accel is at fault? I don't see anything of similar magnitude there. And I'd be surprised if such a small change in acceleration completely messed up the airspeed_filtered topic. (tbh I'm already a bit surprised it's used at all - I had always assumed it was some sort of averaging or lowpass filter. I never actually checked though) I rather think the -1.7m/s² on local_position.ax are caused by cutting the throttle from 31% (cruise) to 0%.\r\n\r\nSilvan Fuhrer  17 days ago\r\nOkay well no, I can't be sure if it's not on the airspeed front.\r\nBTW, the 3m/s after the spike are due to 3 being the min airspeed defined in TECS. That means it dropped below that. https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/af50e25647aa5c2051bb09378bc9b2aaaaeb2a07/src/lib/tecs/TECS.cpp#L150\r\n\r\nThomas Stauber  17 days ago\r\nOk, already good to know where the 3 comes from. (Still not good that it's there haha). I guess it was below that because of how the filter works (https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/af50e25647aa5c2051bb09378bc9b2aaaaeb2a07/src/lib/tecs/TECS.cpp#L146). As _tas_state exploded, subsequently _tas_innov was heavily negative, and therefore also tas_state_input .\r\nApart from initialisation the only place there _tas_state gets updated is L147, so if we can track down all occurrences of the terms of that equation (respectively of the line above), we should be able to get an idea where it could have come from. I assume if the dt was the problem we'd have other problems too, so remaining are _tas_rate_state , _tas_rate_raw , _tas_innov and _tas_estimate_freq . _tas_estimate_freq  is pretty safe to exclude, leaving us with _tas_rate_state , _tas_rate_raw and _tas_innov .\r\n_tas_rate_state : can only be fucked up if _tas_innov (or _tas_estimate_freq or dt)is fucked up.\r\n_tas_rate_raw : that would indeed be the body_acceleration. Nothing logged, but maybe it was too short a spike ?\r\n_tas_innov : either _EAS or EAS2TAS is wrong. EAS2TAS is constrained between 0.9 and 2.0, so not possible. _EAS is the airspeed_validated.calibrated_airspeed_m_s  topic. Same as for _tas_rate_raw there is no logged spike.\r\nI hope I didn't miss any occurrences in my analysis. So it looks like it's either the body_acceleration or the airspeed measurement that went wild for a short spike (or something else broke completely during execution and caused some memory spill / overflow or other very unlikely erroneous behaviour, which I think we can almost certainly exclude as the rest was still working properly)\r\n\r\nThomas Stauber  17 days ago\r\nMaybe moving to another filter that wouldn't be so affected by any spike would really make sense as Roman Bapst mentioned above.\r\n",

  "body": "Pixhawk 4\r\n1.11.3 - Fixed Wing\r\n\r\nAfter some debate on this I decided to open an issue.\r\n\r\nNavigation between waypoints is not consistent and does not follow the expected direction (more detail below). The direction is circuitous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first log, it was clear there was some mag interference (this was seen on the ground prior to takeoff - approximately 10 degrees could not be corrected even after multiple calibrations) but the issue was that the trajectory from one waypoint to the next does not make sense (in parts of the flight). Instead of going from one point to the next, there are large turns between them.\r\n\r\nI questioned if this was due to an insufficient SD card speed for reading the mission. Testing the SD card speed in QGC gave an average speed of 63kb/s (much too slow but this was only changed after these flights) and there are logging dropouts at some of the points in the log. Right around 22 min where the location looks to be sideways, it was not. In the telemetry replay it does a coordinated turn. This turn at least makes sense, that is the direction is was supposed to go. That changes though later in the same flight.\r\n\r\nAt 22:46 it looks like the aircraft starts to circle down. Maybe to hit the altitude set-point but that does not make too much sense seems it looks like it doesnt actually miss it. After it does circle down though it then just decides to go left (no errors still) and then circle around again. Mag issue? There is no reason for a turn to be in that direction though. The question becomes is if this is mag related and or SD card read access speed and mission related.\r\n\r\nLog 1 - \r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=72ac3453-0872-447d-8716-3fcca37c1e9e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe below log had a new mag installed and there weren't any offsets observed or mag ratios, etc but at 13:17 instead of turning left, the aircraft made a roll to the right before banking to the left to turn. Additionally, it went directly through the waypoint before turning instead of starting at the L1 distance and making the typical rounded turn. From 13:18-13:25 the log looks like the aircraft is going to the wrong direction but there is also a log dropout there, in the telemetry log the orientation and direction looks correct in terms of how the aircraft flew but not why it still turned so late and went right then left. \r\n\r\n\r\nLog 2-\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=1e2b37e4-b557-45d3-9f73-6fb099bf0fa4",

  "title": "Altitude Losses and Gains: Possible Barometer Issues",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15096",
  "body": "**Description:**\r\nPX4 struggles to hold altitude using the barometer in both the AltHold and PosHold flight modes. Cross-breezes result in altitude gains/losses. Maneuvers result in altitude loss. Typically, the more rapid the maneuver the larger the altitude loss.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n_Method 1_\r\n1. Drone switched into position hold and armed after a 3D-lock is obtained.\r\n2. Take off to an altitude far beyond the ground-effect zone.\r\n3. Pick an axis to evaluate (eg. positive x-axis)\r\n4. Perform a full-stick maneuver along that axis until max horizontal speed is achieved.\r\n5. Release the sticks\r\n6. Altitude is lost near the end of the position change and during the braking maneuver. For these maneuvers the altitude returns to the set-point after 2-5sec (far too long).\r\n[Maneuver Altitude Loss]( https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=4972dc44-0636-4abc-a065-dbc4c23d32f5)\r\n\r\n_Method 2_\r\n1. Drone switched into position hold and armed after a 3D-lock is obtained.\r\n2. Take off to an altitude far beyond the ground-effect zone.\r\n3. Release sticks (no RC input). \r\n4. Wait for a cross-breeze\r\n5. Altitude raises or lowers (multiple meters). During these tests the drone very slowly (10-25sec), if ever, returns to the setpoint. \r\n[Wind Altitude Gain/Loss](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=511f8756-384c-4a3d-b214-4f9a8f401b58)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nIn AltHold and in PosHold, if the z-setpoint is not changed, the craft will not change altitude.   \r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n_Method 1_\r\n![Forward Dip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66424788/84535991-eb4fee00-acba-11ea-9d09-45d2a5344f4c.png)\r\nCaption: Note the bulge in the barometer altitude coupled with the decrease in thrust both of which result in a dip during and after maneuvers.\r\n\r\n_Method 2_\r\n![Wind Altitude Gain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66424788/84535994-ebe88480-acba-11ea-8888-dcaf1bbf9951.png)\r\nCaption: Note the three bulges in velocity and the area between the actual and desired curves. NO RC commands or values were given between 2:40 and the 3:25 time-stamps. After 3:25, the drone started to gain many meters of altitude at which point a downward RC command is given. Even though almost full-stick down is commanded, the copter continued to rise until the breeze (2-5mph) settled. \r\n\r\n**Craft Specifications:**\r\nThe craft itself runs 18x5.5in props on a 900mm frame and uses a Holybro Pixhawk 4 running PX4. The craft is rather heavy but well within the motors and batteries specifications for thrust and power available/required respectively.\r\nFirmware version v1.10.1 was used for all initial testing. Firmware version v1.11.0-beta2was used to connect external barometers through the I2C port (ex. for BMP388) because this is not provisioned for in v1.10.1.\r\nThese same performance issues are also present and reproducible on a much lighter craft (15x5.5 props, 750mm frame, Pixhawk 4, v1.10.1).\r\n\r\n**Attempted Solutions:**\r\n1)\tThe first tests were performed using the stock on-board MS5611 barometer with no shielding. The flight performance was fine but produced noticeable dips upon maneuvering in any direction. \r\n2)\tThe issue  https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/10058 suggested shielding the barometer, and adjusting the EKF2_BARO_NSE, EKF2_PCOEF_%%%, EKF2_BCOEF_%%%, and EKF2_DRAG NOISE parameters. Shielding the barometer in an indirectly ported enclosure did not produce noticeable differences. (in either data or performance). Adding open-cell foam around the PX4 inside the enclosure also did not produce noticeable differences. Moving the barometer very far away from the propellers did not produce noticeable differences.\r\n3)\tAfter shielding and isolation were tested and had no effect on the problem, the suggested parameters began to be changed but shielding with enclosure and foam was kept for the remaining test. Setting the XN, XP, YN, and YP EKF2_PCOEFs to their minimum value of -.5 very slightly reduced the dip (10-30cm out of 1-3m). \r\n4)\tAfter PCOEFs were ineffectual, the BCOEFs were next to be altered. A theoretical ballistic coefficient was calculated for this aircraft using the drag coefficient of a flat-plate, the mass of the aircraft, and the area of the central plate. The calculated value was 23.96kg/m^2 (1kg/m^2 lower than default). The ballistic coefficient parameter was altered from minimum to maximum values. The EFK2_drag.innovations[0:1] were examined after each flight but did not change in RMS value. EKF2 Replay was attempted using JMavSim on a Windows 10 machine but errors were thrown upon completion of the documentation steps and replay never worked. Changing BCOEFs had little to no effect on the EKF2 innovations for both drag and wind estimation.\r\n5)\tThe last of the suggested parameters was EKF2_BARO_NSE. Raising EKF2_BARO_NSE to a value of 5m improved flight performance and reduced dips while maneuvering. This is NOT a solution to the problem as all it does is transition estimation authority from to the barometer to the GPS. The entire intent of this testing is to have consistent altitude performance even without GPS assistance (to fly in buildings and structures) therefore this is not the most desirable solution.\r\n6)\tAfter the above parameters failed to solve the problem, the EKF2_HGT_MODE was changed from barometer to GPS. This stopped the dip from occurring but once again is not a solution. After GPS was used, a downward-facing LIDAR was used with range-aid enabled without it being the primary height sensor and with range-aid and as the primary height sensor. Both of these removed the dip while maneuvering and followed terrain well. These too are undesired solutions due to limited LIDAR range and the possibility of ground-based objects messing up the LIDAR altitude estimation.\r\n7)\tThe next series of testing began with an external barometer/GPS from Zubax enabled via UAVCAN. This also featured the MS5611 chip and yielded the same results as the on-board MS5611 for all of the above tests. This GPS was also enclosed in the Zubax designed enclosure with open cell foam in the barometer enclosure (inside the overall enclosure). With UAVCAN enabled, both the external barometer and the external GPS were used as the primary GPS and barometer but did not produce noticeable differences in flight performance.\r\n8)\tNo other types of barometers were supported in v1.10.1 so v1.11.0-beta2 was used for the rest of the testing. The v1.11.0-beta2 code was altered to enable the driver for the BMP388 acquired from Adafruit. The MS5611 driver was also disabled to ensure that the BMP388 would be used for pressure-height data and not the on-board sensor. The PIDs for the rate, attitude, and XY- position controllers were able to be tuned to achieve the desired performance. The Z-position/velocity controller gains were left at default. Hover flight could be achieved as expected however, when a breeze blew the craft would gain altitude and not settle back to the set-point. The second log of the 3-4min flight is the best example of this. No control input would be given and the craft would gain altitude at the maximum allowed vertical speed (2m/s, default = 3m/s). The P and I values of the controller were reduced to close-to or just above the minimum allowed values (to create a sluggish and under-tuned controller) and still the craft would ascend at maximum vertical speed in a slight cross-breeze (2-5mph). For the end of the flight, the rise in altitude was partially counteracted by a downward RC command but almost full-stick down was commanded before the aircraft consistently began to descend.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**  \r\nI hypothesize that both flight abnormalities are caused by the pressure changes across the barometer. That being said, all tested barometers were a fully enclosed as they could have been without rendering them inoperable. My second hypothesis is that the altitude fusion in the EKF2 does not handle these barometer fluctuations well. The same craft flown with a DJI A3 controller does not have these problems when flown under the same conditions (wind, maneuvers, poor GPS environment, etc.). These logs and descriptions hopefully show problems with dynamic pressure handling (either craft moving in static air or air moving over static craft) that Pixhawk 4 has. This problem effects AltHold, PosHold, and Loiter flight modes and mission performance in many different scenarios and its significant diminishment or removal would make PX4 based systems more useful and versatile. \r\n",

  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen a mission is stopped midway, and the drone then lands, receives a new mission with all items having ``current=0`` parameters and is armed again, the drone immediately flies towards the waypoint from the old mission, instead of executing the first item on the new mission. This crashed our drone as it tilts and tries to fly forward before properly \"takeoff\" to a safe altitude, thus catching the ground with the landing struts.  \r\n\r\nThe resetting of ``mission_current`` seems to happen upon arming, but there seems to be some sort of race-condition, as the drone reports ``mission_current`` to reset to 0 upon arming, but the log shows the drone still gets a setpoint for the old waypoint and tries to fly that, before the ``mission_current`` index reset is realised.\r\n\r\nThomas Stauber spotted that our velocity controller asked for a 3m/s horizontal velocity immediately upon arming, which indicated that the drone was flying towards an old mission item.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7889925/82942796-d4aa5700-9f98-11ea-85f8-13f5744f75a6.png) \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps we did to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n1. Fly normal mission\r\n2. Before normal mission finishes, switch mode to \"land now\" or \"RTL\" and land the drone\r\n3. Start new flight with identical mission. (It uploads the same mission again, but doesn't clear the old one first)\r\n4. Arm and send \"start_mission\" command\r\n5. Drone attempts to fly to the waypoint it was at in the last mission and thus flip in the direction of that waypoint.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUpon uploading a new mission with no ``current=1`` parameters set, we would expect the drone to reset the current-index of mission items to 0. Intuitively I would expect the index to get reset when the PX4 accepts the new mission and sends ``MAV_MISSION_ACCEPTED`` and not first on arming the drone. \r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nflight log: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=116b78e1-7732-4e6e-acf8-88e640d8cdfc \r\nvideo of the takeoff and flip: https://nextcloud.sdu.dk/index.php/s/46H7m9TXgXkQqQF\r\n\r\nlog from our GCS rosbag, showing the ``mission_current`` is not reset until arming, but keeps the old missions current index. The new mission had been uploaded and accepted by the PX4 before this snippet from the log:\r\n```\r\n---\r\ndata: 0\r\n---\r\ndata: 0\r\n---            <----------- a second before it changes to 15, the flightmode of the FC is set to \"Auto - Mission\".

  "title": "Large negative Pitch Setpoint at takeoff, hand launched Fixed Wing",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10076",
  "body": "Most of our fixed wing flight logs show a large negative step input to the pitch command right at Takeoff.  I think the \"minimum pitch\" param in the Takeoff Waypoint overrides this, but behind the scenes something is wrong.\n\nI've seen users attempt to auto-takeoff to a non-Takeoff Waypoint and the vehicle immediately noses into the ground.\n\nI suspect some bad interactions between LandDetector and typical ground handling of hand launched fixed wings, but I'm not sure what exactly...  (fyi @dagar we discussed previously).\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12117027/43370412-3c14b920-9344-11e8-8599-5b2aa06673f4.png)\n\nHere are a number of logs that show this issue right at Takeoff:\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=80301c1d-fac9-4a8a-a5e1-870927233e64\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=6f7119a2-c6c3-4d0c-88e5-8debcf59e88f\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=a8b193bc-f3d7-4cab-ae3e-ba0302c1834b\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=13dcbb27-7d97-49d4-94d3-0f092d283c7c\n\nRelated PR that attempts to improve Fixed Wing takeoff, might need to look into the root cause of this issue here:\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/9243",
