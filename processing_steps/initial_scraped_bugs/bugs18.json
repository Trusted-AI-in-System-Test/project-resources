am having an issue with a very heavy prototype VTOL that I'm building and I am seeing an issue that I am not sure where this behavior could be coming from. As I am hovering, sometimes the bird yaws hard and loses altitude. I think the fact I lose altitude indicates to me that we don't have enough thrust to push through the decent caused by spooling down half of the motors in the yaw.\n\nWhile I have been digging through the logs, I noticed a point where the yaw setpoint jump sharply at 7:36. I also noticed a baro EKF error and would that case an EKF reset on the mags which could cause a sharp heading change?\n\nI feel like this might just be a poor calibration and tune but I thought I would ping you to see if you have any great

guys,\n\nI define it as feature request although it has bug connotation to it.\n\nWe've had this discussion on the git before about how should the VTOL Return function be implemented.\n\nFour days ago we had a total crash of our plane fully loaded ~10k US.\n\nThis was a case where the Return original behavior though consistent somehow crashed the plane.\n\nWe had to perform a mission flight at 1000 m height. So we prefer to gain the altitude by hand or in big loiter and when the altitude is gained we activate the mission.\nEverything went ok at first. The pilot gained altitude but at that height you barely see the VTOL. He climbed to 1000m and activated the mission. But there was something wrong with the mission. So he decided to abort the mission. During this moments the plane was gone in Position for 30 seconds in one direction. The pilot could not find the vtol in the sky so by telemetry in the QGC he saw where the plane is and decided to activate Return. He told me \"I could not see the plane but I heard the motors of the quad ramping and the plane obviously transitioning to MC.\" \n\nSo imagine in this moment if you want to perform RTL. 1000m descending in MC with 1.5m/s... If it is emergency landing there is no way the battery could hold 1000m.\n\nThe pilot then decided to make a transition back to FW flight.  He is not sure what he had done with the controls in this situation, either he removed the Return mode and continued on POS or just flipped the transition switch while in Return mode... The result is that the moment he saw the VTOL it was nosediving in FW flight 80 degrees down to the lake without any control what so ever.\n\nWe try to retrieve the plane with divers to recover the SD card with LOGS if possible and SD card with video. No luck so far...\n\nWe have the auto-saved .tlog files but the qgroundcontrol is somehow broken and does not want to replay the .tlog files.\n\nThe main point is we want to have RTL or Return for the VTOL to behave exactly like an airplane up to the moment it reaches the RTL_DESCEND_ALT altitude. Then it will loiter for the wait period then transition and land. \n\nIf this was the implemented behavior,  in our situation the pilot could activate Return mode the VTOL could have spiraled down to 30 meters probably, make a loiter for the waiting period and then transition to MC and land.\n\nAlso in missions if we want to use the Return command at the end of the mission to return the vtol it will perform the return at current altitude and transition, and then start in MC to descend. This makes us to have to program the return with descending points before we land at the end of the mission. If the return is implemented correctly the end of the mission could be just using the RTL point in the route planner.\n\nBecause there are people that would like to have the current behavior it might be enabled or disabled with parameter.\n\nAt least this is a 10k US lesson learned.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10176","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10176/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10176/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10176/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10176","id":348071782,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDgwNzE3ODI=","number":10176,"title":"MPC_YAW_MODE

When I type \"px4flow status\" in the mavlink command, it responds \"driver not running.\" I have narrowed it down to a problem specific to the Pixhawk 4 firmware, as all of my other Pixhawks immediately recognize and initiate optical flow from the PX4FLOW.

When I check the logs, the FCU will send back an error. The following is the output of MAVROS:\n\n```\n[ WARN] [1532985278.000720962]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 46.27 ms.\n[ERROR] [1532985278.143875280]: FCU: CRITICAL NAVIGATION FAILURE - CHECK SENSOR CALIBR\n[ERROR] [1532985278.197775320]: FCU: Failsafe enabled: no local position\n[ INFO] [1532985278.245378081]: FCU: Failsafe mode enabled\n[ WARN] [1532985278.597816504]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 42.97 ms.\n```\n\n\nI also write a python script to send waypoints missions through MAVROS. The RTF can take off smoothly but cannot reach the correct waypoint. I got the following error:\n\n```\n[ INFO] [1532985449.482349651]: WP: mission cleared\n[ INFO] [1532985449.541545251]: FCU: Mission finished, landed.\n[ INFO] [1532985449.543720535]: WP: mission sended\n[ INFO] [1532985449.625598097]: FCU: Executing Mission\n[ INFO] [1532985449.680501045]: FCU: Takeoff to 2.0 meters above home.\n[ INFO] [1532985449.728870793]: FCU: Takeoff detected\n[ WARN] [1532985450.024027304]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 43.39 ms.\n[ WARN] [1532985450.635279594]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 54.29 ms.\n[ WARN] [1532985452.126519588]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 45.43 ms.\n[ WARN] [1532985453.226403318]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 45.00 ms.\n[ WARN] [1532985454.420344494]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 39.70 ms.\n[ WARN] [1532985455.127577130]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 46.35 ms.\n[ERROR] [1532985455.339997338]: FCU: CRITICAL NAVIGATION FAILURE - CHECK SENSOR CALIBR\n[ERROR] [1532985455.424013207]: FCU: Failsafe enabled: no global position\n[ INFO] [1532985455.439297617]: FCU: Failsafe mode enabled\n[ WARN] [1532985455.722783648]: TM : RTT too high for timesync: 41.41 ms.\n```\n\nI wonder why this critical navigation failure error occurs. Is this a PX4 issue or a hardware issue with Intel Aero RTF? It seems the sensors are not correctly calibrated. I follow the instructions on QGroundControl to calibrate the senors. But the error still pops out. BTW: I check the GPS information from QGroundControl before each flight. It seems normal and 3D Lock is enabled.\n\n\n```\nBIOS_VERSION =Aero-01.00.13\nOS_VERSION = Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS\"\nAIRMAP_VERSION = unknown\nFPGA_VERSION = 0xc2\nAeroFC firmware version = 1.8.0\n```\n\nLet me know if you need any further information.

the bug**\nSetting MPC_THR_HOVER to 0.6, my quad hovers at RC channel 0.5 (a bit overloaded vehicle). When I now switch to AltHold (with LIDAR attached), the thrust setpoint is set to 0.5 which causes a drop of the vehicle. After correction by RC (and going back to RC = 0.5), AltHold works perfectly at thrust 0.6. Position mode is set to 'smooth'. \n\n**Expected behavior**\nI assumed that with MPC_THR_HOVER = 0.6, the set point of thrust is set to 0.6 instead of 0.5.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nI will share log later. \n\n<img width=\"1024\" alt=\"hover\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7580193/43212346-0109cea0-9034-11e8-930b-95d5b07b1719.png\">","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10036","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10036/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10036/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10036/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10036","id":344456013,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDQ0NTYwMTM=","number":10036,"title":"Safety switch not changing its state","user":{"login":"shabhu18","id":8255663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8255663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18","html_url":"https://github.com/shabhu18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shabhu18/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"santiago3dr","id":13203106,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAzMTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13203106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr","html_url":"https://github.com/santiago3dr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"santiago3dr","id":13203106,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAzMTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13203106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr","html_url":"https://github.com/santiago3dr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santiago3dr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-07-25T13:59:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T15:29:24Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T12:27:00Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"my system\npixhawk 2.1\npx4 version : 1.8\ngps+compass+safety switch is connected in GPS1 port of pixhawk 2.1\n\n\nIssue : The safety switch doesn't changes its state to arm state.

the bug**\n\nThe option to save the initial declination loaded from the geo library to the EKF2_MAG_DECL parameter on disarm so that it can be loaded as the startup default for the next power cycle is supposed to be controlled via setting of the EKF2_DECL_TYPE parameter. However inspection of the code shows that this capability is now missing from ekf2_main.cpp\n\nIt is supposed to save the value obtained from the copy_mag_decl_deg(float *val) accessor function to the EKF2_MAG_DECL parameter if bit position 1 in EKF2_DECL_TYPE is set to true.\n\nAdditionally the comment and function name on that accessor function is misleading. It should read\n\n\t// Get the value of magnetic declination in degrees to be saved for use at the next startup\n\t// At the next startup, set param.mag_declination_deg to the value saved\n\tvoid get_mag_decl_deg(float *val)\n\nA separate PR will be raised against the ecl library to fix that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10023/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10009","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10009/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10009/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10009/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/10009","id":343689808,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjAzMjYyODE2","number":10009,"title":"Fix

Analysis of the logs showed that the mag measurements (external HMC5983, internal mags disabled) are not changing one bit. This was only fixed by power cycling the vehicle, rebooting the FC did not change anything.\n\nThere are two problems with this incident:\n1) The mag malfunctioned. Has anybody seen something like this before?\n2) More importantly: Why was this not detected by the flight controller? Should this data not be marked stale / timed out and arming in position controlled modes/switching to these modes refused?\n\nIn addition to the mag measurements being constant, EKF2's heading innovations (configured to heading only fusion) are constant, i.e. no mag measurements are fused. This makes sense considering that the mag measurements are old (`sensor_combined_0.magnetometer_timestamp_relative + sensor_combined_0.timestamp` is constant). But the heading / position estimate is not marked invalid by EKF2.\n\nOur firmware is based on 1.7.4.\n\nHere is a log file: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=8f1505e6-f998-47e4-9693-58c3c0424774\n\nAny help would be appreciated!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9871","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9871/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9871/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9871/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9871","id":339714208,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzk3MTQyMDg=","number":9871,"title":"Cannot build px4fmu-v5_default, incompatible compiler flags","user":{"login":"potaito","id":3762382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3762382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito","html_url":"https://github.com/potaito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potaito/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-07-10T06:49:26Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T13:41:51Z","closed_at":"2018-07-10T12:06:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"When building `make px4fmu-v5_default` I get `switch -mcpu=cortex-m7 conflicts with -march=armv7e-m switch`.

fixed-wing first-order altitude hold (FOH) is currently causing altitude reference oscillations when in any LOITER mode. See screenshot below. Not only altitude, but also pitch and throttle can thus oscillate significantly. We observed this during a recent test flight.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2565608/42387985-53c6343e-8144-11e8-86d2-a42aecc4c5c0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLog file from SITL where this can be seen: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=f18c45ab-622e-4b1d-9819-03cfb06af2b5 . Here, after t=3:20 the true altitude setpoint is still the same as before t=2:20 (i.e. 630m AMSL) but the FOH logic just wrongly sets it to 660m and adds slight oscillations on top. The exact amount of oscillations depends on waypoint distance, altitude difference etc, but i have seen altitude ref oscillations of up to 30m, resulting in full pitch up/down of the aircraft.\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\nSee the commit for the location of the code where this is happening. Essentially, every time that the loiter radius of any loiter WP is larger than the acceptance radius calculated from the L1 turn distance, then the Navigator FOH would _not_ consider the waypoint reached and would thus not stop modifying the current altitude setpoint. This leads to the oscillations or offsets in the altitude reference. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nIf in any loiter mode, consider the loiter radius times a factor of 1.2 (same as for the waypoint_reached logic [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L217) as the acceptance radius. Tested in SITL, which should be sufficient for this case.\r\n\r\n@acfloria @ryanjAA @antiheavy FYI\r\n@dagar Made this PR as a quick hotfix independently of your PR at https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/8883/files which supposedly also fixes this but is much larger and where it is more uncertain when this would be merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9850/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9841","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9841/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9841/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9841/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9841","id":338446885,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzg0NDY4ODU=","number":9841,"title":"Streaming identical messages","user":{"login":"superware","id":6965177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6965177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware","html_url":"https://github.com/superware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superware/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-07-05T06:52:49Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T14:01:11Z","closed_at":"2018-07-13T13:30:26Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\nSome messages are not streamed if nothing has changed in their data.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1.

are currently two IMU messages which can be streamed via mavlink to a companion computer which runs a vision algorithm. At the moment I think none of them is really suited due to the following reasons:\n\n1) HIGHRES_IMU\n- these are the imu values from the sensor_combined topic\n- the gyro & accel values are low pass filtered which might not be optimal for vision\n- sensor_combined does contain unfiltered delta velocity and delta angle data which would be suited for estimation but the vision algorithms normally don't support this\n\n2) SCALED_IMU\n- these should be raw values (no filtering) and ideal for vision\n- for any other platform than Snapdragon the values written to the message are wrong (this is because Snapdragon uses a different driver which does the computation correctly). The mavlink module assumes that the fields x_raw, y_raw, z_raw in the sensor_accl & sensor_gyro topic have units m/s² and rad/s respectively. However, the native Nuttx drivers do not apply the necessary scaling and so the assumption is wrong. It's also not very helpful that the orb message does not indicate what units these fields should have, see https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/sensor_accel.msg#L13\n- the sensor data of this topic is represented in the board frame. There is not way the companion computer side can figure out the board rotation. The values should be rotated according to the board rotation before being sent out.\n\n**How to fix this**\n- first of all we should add documentation to the orb message indicating the units of the raw imu data\n- we need to rotate the imu data when preparing the SCALED_IMU message (both board rotation and board rotation offset)\n- we either need to fix the NuttX drivers or the mavlink module (depending on what units the x/y/z_raw fields will have) so that the SCALED_IMU message does not contain garbage.\n\n- Alternatively we could argue to use the HIGHRES_IMU message. In that case we need to add unfiltered sensor data to it. It actually already contains unfiltered delta velocities and delta angles which would be suited for estimation, however, if the vision algorithms do not support these then they are useless.\n\n@LorenzMeier @mhkabir

The ROI all-zeros bug\r\n\r\nWhen transmitting a mission with QGC, occasionally the ROI waypoints are broken in the sense that the ROI lat/lon is set to `(0.0, 0.0)`. Some digging showed that this only happens when the `MAV_CMD` used to send the mission is in INT mode. The reason is the conversion  from `mavlink_mission` to `mission_item`. In INT mode the latitude and longitude need scaling:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_mission.cpp#L1282-L1294\r\n\r\nHowever, further down when setting the ROI parameters for LAT/LONG/ALT, the conversion is missing and the values are simply copied (cast) regardless of `_int_mode`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_mission.cpp#L1355-L1363\r\n\r\nA proposed fix is in the first commit.\r\n\r\n### Reproducing the issue:\r\nThe bug occurs only when the vehicle already has a mission loaded, with is removed in QGC, and then a new mission is sent containing the ROI. I am not sure why in one case INT mode is used, and in another case it's not...\r\n\r\n## ROI waypoint floating-point precision\r\nLooking at the situation with @MaEtUgR and @julianoes, we noticed that some precision is lost when using the parameter fields (float) of the vehicle message to store/access the ROI latitude and longitude (param 5 and param6):\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L445-L463\r\n\r\nInstead, we can just as well use the mission item's latitude and longitude, which are `double`s instead of `float`s:\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/navigator/navigation.h#L135-L153\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is in the second commit, making the other commit redundant. \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n@julianoes Please take a look

I hope PX4 developers to help finding the reason of crash.\n\nA delta-quad type VTOL drone crashed on the water while in transition flight trials of a developing drone after logging is stopped after 'vtol_att_control low on stack' warning happened  but telemetry log sustained from the logging stop to the crash.\n\nI am not sure this is a bug or not, but upload logs for analysis.\n\n**Environment:**\nPX4 v1.7.3, Pixhawk 2.1, QGC v3.3.1, Ubuntu 14.03, DeltaQuad airframe\n\n**Changed parts of source code:**\nMixer script change for two yaw motors that separately mounted.\nMultirotor mixer mix() function change (not to include yaw control in quadrotors)\nMAVLink stream SERVO_OUTPUT_RAW_1 and ACTUATOR_CONTROL_TARGET_0 were added.\nNo change in vtol_attitude_control and other modules.\n\n**Flight procedure:**\nIn manual (stabilized) mode in multicopter phase of VTOL the drone was hovering.\nIn the state, the transition switch was turned on and it flew in manual (not stabilized) mode of forward transition phase.\nWhen it reaches to fixed-wing mode, the transition switch was tuned off because its altitude became to decline (the lift force is small because its forward thrust is small).\nIn the second trial of this transition flight the accident happened.\n\n**Peculiar things:**\nIn previous several flights, the flight mode of fixed-wing phase was stabilized mode and any accident did not happened. But in the accident the mode was manual mode for the first time though I don't know it is related or not to the cause.\n\n**Log flies:**\n- a ulog file ([flight log](https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5ddb8655-0658-4c3b-9282-69bc692587f8))\nThe below files can be given to people who want more:\n- a tlog file (telemetry log) :  the file is corrupted by the abrupt disconnection of communication and cannot be loaded by QGC\n- a telemetry text log converted from the tlog file\n- a global position text log file extracted from the tlog

Issue:\nDuring fix-wing autolands, a flare is commanded by increasing a pitch reference as long as the downwards velocity is >0.1m/s as seen [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L1487). However, this pitch increase together with the fact that the motor may not be disabled yet (i.e. we have reached FW_LND_FLALT but not FW_LND_TLALT) can result in vel_d<0.1m/s (i.e. aircraft does not descend anymore or even ascends in altitude). In that case, [this line ](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L1492) indicates that the current pitch set point (att_sp.pitch_body) should just be kept, which is in general OK. However, [this line](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L1710) constantly increases att_sp.pitch_body with the pitch offset parameter during every iteration.  \n\nThis issue thus only occurs if FW_PSP_OFF!=0, and also just occurs during the flare-mode because in all other modes the attitude setpoint is constantly reset by TECS. This is probably why so few people (if any) have seen this bug so far. The result is however potentially disastrous, i.e. a pitch up including a stall of the aircraft can happen. This was tested in HIL so far, see the image below. Note the pitch_ref >90° ....\n\n![screenshot from 2018-06-14 14-21-11_mod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2565608/41412042-0d2d5b04-6fdf-11e8-9bfb-6d2201dbb4b0.png)\n\n### Solution:\nIntroduce separate variable that is NOT automatically incremented by  [this line](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L1710). I also thought about whether we could just NOT increment att_sp in line 1710, and then just publish the att_sp.pitch+offset in that code section, but that seemed more tedious code-wise to me.\n\n@tstastny

I used this approach when first trying out the PX4/Firmware software, but now I was going to proceed to use ROS, so I wanted to build the PX4/Firmware as a ROS package.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n0. Clone Firmware inside your ros_workspace/src folder (master branch)\n1. Build the package: cd ros_workspace/src && catkin build px4\n2. Build fails with messages of the type: \"Cannot find ecl.h, not such file or directory\"\n\nPS.- FYI, I just tried building (catkin build) the Firmware version v1.7.3 and that works fine (I still have to test some launch files, but at least the ROS package compiling finished successfully). I'll report if this version works fine, since that might mean that the compilation error might have been introduced between then and the current master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9554/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9540","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9540/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9540/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9540/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9540","id":326857933,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjY4NTc5MzM=","number":9540,"title":"FW Mission Start -

Bug Report\n\n### Explaination\n\nThe gazebo **optical flow** simulation is incredibly slow using 1.8.0b branch but fast using 1.7.3 branch.\n\nDoing the simulation without PX4Flow works at full speed.\n\n### Observations\n\nOn 1.8.0.beta **with** PX4Flow:\n- When the copter moves, the real-time factor starts to drop as low as 0.02.\n- When the copter is hovering, the copter has a real-time factor of 1.0.\n\nOn 1.8.0.beta **without** PX4Flow: \n- The real-time factor stays at 1.0 during the whole offboard mission.\n\nOn 1.7.3 **with** PX4Flow: \n- The real-time factor stays at 1.0 during the whole offboard mission.\n\n\n### Reproduce the problem:\n \n**v1.8.0b PX4Flow**\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive http://github.com/PX4/Firmware -b v1.8.0-beta1 PX4.1.8.0b\ncd PX4.1.8.0b\nmake -j8 posix gazebo_iris_opt_flow \nroslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=\"udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557\"\n# Run a mission: goto(3,0,0), goto(6,0,0), goto(0,0,0) \n```\n\n**v1.8.0b without PX4Flow**\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive http://github.com/PX4/Firmware -b v1.8.0-beta1 PX4.1.8.0b\ncd PX4.1.8.0b\nmake -j8 posix gazebo_iris\nroslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=\"udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557\"\n# Run a mission: goto(3,0,0), goto(6,0,0), goto(0,0,0) \n```\n\n**v1.7.3 PX4Flow**\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive http://github.com/PX4/Firmware -b v1.7.3 PX4.1.7.3\ncd PX4.1.7.3\nmake -j8 posix gazebo_iris_opt_flow \nroslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=\"udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557\"\n# Run a mission: goto(3,0,0), goto(6,0,0), goto(0,0,0)

was tested on a slightly modified version of PX4 Master\n\nAfter letting the vehicle sit for an extended period of time we are experiencing two errors \"PREFLIGHT FAIL: EKF INTERNAL CHECKS\" and \"PREFLIGHT FAIL: HIGH IMU ACCEL BIAS\". We recalibrated the accelerometers but still experienced these issues. If the plane is armed moderately quickly after booting up and there are no errors thrown, and the aircraft flies normally.\n\nHere are some log examples of the preflight fails on ground:\n\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=a0fb96a2-de2f-4e2d-a4f6-0f930ea53248\n\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=42eda972-2802-4d1e-b236-bed93244427c\n\nWe also had a case where the aircraft threw a \"PREFLIGHT FAIL: HIGH IMU ACCEL BIAS\" error but then still allowed us to arm. On takeoff the aircraft flew erratically and had to be taken over with manual control. Log is posted below.\n\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=e29821e7-9539-46ec-b563-79be1b655cf4","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},
