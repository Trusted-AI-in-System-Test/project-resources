The pilot tried to compensate by tilting the drone in the opposite direction, however, he reached the limit position of the roll stick on the RC and the roll still continued to drift. The high velocity led to a rough crash into a wooden bench. There was no RC signal loss and we checked that the RC had no trims and subtrims in effect.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time we experienced this behavior after ~4 years working with PX4 firmware.\r\n\r\n[Flight 2](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=5dc3d4bb-5c16-4ec6-b7ad-17f2456e4f3b)\r\nThe second incident we had was the next day on the same location with different hardware, but the same symptoms. After ~30s of manual flight in altitude mode (~5m height above floor) the UAV started tilting uncontrollably and then crashed into a wall. Again no RC signal losses, no trims and subtrims. We were even flying with this platform the same day in the morning for ~10 minutes without any issues [(OK Flight)](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=e0c02122-4335-4ce3-ab3d-598a38e98c7f).\r\n\r\nPlease find attached logs and description of the hardware in the following sections. My colleague will also upload a video which compares the PX4 estimated attitude with the correctly estimated attitude obtained from a custom attitude estimator run on the recorded IMU flight data.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of this behavior? Could there be a bug in the attitude estimator that only manifests in some highly specific conditions? Is there some problem apparent from the logs that we are missing?\r\n\r\nPlease ask for any relevant additional information that could help solving the issue. Until we resolve this issue we cannot fly indoor in this setup, because it is too unreliable and dangerous.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nWe tried to reproduce the behavior in lower height above floor with another drone with the same setup as in the first flight without success. \r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n[Flight

This results in the aircraft motors saturating earlier then expected.\r\nIn order to fix the issue I have to set a standard airframe before calibration (e.g. Hexa X) and then set the new airframe after calibration. \r\n\r\nI think this is happening because the calibration is done setting a thrust requirement that is mixed into a PWM requirement, instead of directly PWM requirements.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCreate an airframe in which the thrust is not split equally between the motors, and try calibrating the ESCs with QGroundControl. Look at the ESC calibration MIN and MAX PWM values.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect the ESC calibration to be completely uncoupled from the actual airframe selected, and the ESCs min and max pwm values to be tuned based on their own max and min values.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nI am not sure how I could show this, as I am using a custom airframe that I have set for

the bug**\r\nAfter launching the PX4 SITL with jMAVSim, after few minutes, the uORB messages (say sensor_accel) stopped updating. \r\nI am using listener command in the PX4 SITL terminal to listen to uORB messages. After 2-3 minutes, I could observe that the uORB messages stopped updating. The uORB timestamp was still showing the older timestamp value and that's how I concluded uORB messages are not getting updated. Surprisingly it was still showing updated 0 seconds ago even though I tried it several minutes later!  Is that indicate the SITL time is somehow frozen?

Keep the terminal idle for few minutes after jMAVSim launched\r\n5. listen to 'sensor_accel' ( listener sensor_accel ) \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n'sensor_accel' should get updated. Even if it was showing old timestamp data, it should not show updated 0 seconds ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWhen you observe this behavior, if you open QGroundControl you can see that it won't connect to the SITL. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15434","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15434/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15434/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15434/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15434","id":667012177,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDU3NzU5NDk4","number":15434,"title":"Rover Airframe 50004_dfrobot_gpx_asurada: Changing of physical parameter","user":{"login":"KatrinMoritz","id":48520405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTIwNDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48520405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz","html_url":"https://github.com/KatrinMoritz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KatrinMoritz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":647657056,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDc2NTcwNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Rover%20%F0%9F%9A%99","name":"Rover 🚙","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":"Rovers and other UGV"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-07-28T11:53:42Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T01:34:22Z","closed_at":"2020-07-29T01:34:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/15434","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15434","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15434.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15434.patch","merged_at":"2020-07-29T01:34:13Z"},"body":"**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nThis PR is related to the Rover Airframe 50004_dfrobot_gpx_asurada.

the bug**\r\nFMU freezes when I plug in an unpowered mb12xx sensor to the AUX5 port and start pwm_input driver. When measured, the voltage on PWM pin is around 2V, for some reason. Plugging the power to the sensor unfreezes the board, as the signal is now correct at 0 or 5V. Tested on Pixhawk Cube with latest fmu-v3_default. Maxbotix sonar connected with pulse width pin. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Plug in Maxbotix sonar sensor not with ADC, but with PW pin connected to AUX5 signal pin.\r\n2. Leave +5V of the sensor floating.\r\n3. Start pwm_input driver\r\n4. The autopilot will (not always) freeze as long as the power pin is unconnected. It will resume when reconnected.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA connection break of the sensor, or having an uncertain logic level at PWM input pin should not freeze the FMU.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\nTested with a proof-of-concept setup, no actual vehicle.\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAfter resuming the operation, error_count field in pwm_input topic is showing large numbers. This suggests that the PWM interrupt triggers continuously freezing the FMU. Proposed solution is to stop the driver from within pwm_input ISR if the error count rises rapidly.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15284","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15284/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15284/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15284/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15284","id":653199948,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTMxOTk5NDg=","number":15284,"title":"ROS/Gazebo build errors \" cannot create target gtest\" ","user":{"login":"diegomrt","id":35877889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODc3ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35877889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt","html_url":"https://github.com/diegomrt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegomrt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1443195042,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQzMTk1MDQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/%F0%9F%A4%96%20ROS","name":"🤖 ROS","color":"202E4A","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-07-08T11:01:14Z","updated_at":"2020-07-19T17:53:05Z","closed_at":"2020-07-19T17:53:04Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I'm trying to build for ROS/Gazebo but I'm getting errors related to existing \"gtest\" and \"GMock\" targets. \r\n\r\nAny hints about how to proceed? \r\n\r\n```\r\nErrors     << mavlink_sitl_gazebo:cmake /home/diego/catkin_ws/logs/mavlink_sitl_gazebo/build.cmake.000.log\r\nCMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.10/Modules/ExternalProject.cmake:2975 (add_custom_target):\r\n  add_custom_target cannot create target \"GMock\" because another target with\r\n  the same name already exists.

pull request combines a few mag sensor pipeline and calibration related improvements and fixes that started to overlap.\r\n\r\n### New functionality\r\n1. sensor mag drop all remaining IOCTLS, move calibration downstream to sensors module entirely with parameters, and perform aggregation in standalone WorkItem rather than voted_sensors_update\r\n     - mag calibration is never cleared, only updated after a new successful calibration\r\n     - this largely mirrors the changes down for accel & gyro recently.\r\n2. magnetometer calibration automatically set the rotation of external magnetometers relative to the first internal (see https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/15120 for more detail).\r\n3. per sensor instance configurable priority (CAL_ACCx_PRIO/CAL_GYROx_PRIO/CAL_MAGx_PRIO)\r\n     - this replaces the existing enable/disable parameters (CAL_ACCx_EN/CAL_GYROx_EN/CAL_MAGx_EN) and the uORB priority concept\r\n4. ~~new helper `systemcmds/mag_test` that simply runs and prints the heading of each sensor_mag instance until you quit~~ I'll bring this in later.\r\n5. remove conservative subscription interval during data acquisition\r\n     - this allows you to go through the full mag cal quite a bit faster (I've compared data before and after on a couple setups)\r\n6. store and use full soft iron calibration matrix (new parameters CAL_MAGx_{X, Y, Z}ODIAG)\r\n   - currently in master we only keep the diagonals\r\n   - https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8265, https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/9136, etc\r\n\r\nAlong the way I discovered a number of potential bugs and the need to properly carry forward additional data in calibration \"slots\" that led to the consolidation of these changes. One problem was again the potential inconsistency between sensor instances (uORB, /dev/magX, calibration slots) that can shift if sensor ordering changes (external mags changed or startup script).\r\n\r\nEDIT (@MaEtUgR): fixes #14829\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15235/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15225","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15225/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15225/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15225/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15225","id":646277577,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDYyNzc1Nzc=","number":15225,"title":"MacOS

NO RC commands or values were given between 2:40 and the 3:25 time-stamps. After 3:25, the drone started to gain many meters of altitude at which point a downward RC command is given. Even though almost full-stick down is commanded, the copter continued to rise until the breeze (2-5mph) settled. \r\n\r\n**Craft Specifications:**\r\nThe craft itself runs 18x5.5in props on a 900mm frame and uses a Holybro Pixhawk 4 running PX4. The craft is rather heavy but well within the motors and batteries specifications for thrust and power available/required respectively.\r\nFirmware version v1.10.1 was used for all initial testing. Firmware version v1.11.0-beta2was used to connect external barometers through the I2C port (ex. for BMP388) because this is not provisioned for in v1.10.1.\r\nThese same performance issues are also present and reproducible on a much lighter craft (15x5.5 props, 750mm frame, Pixhawk 4, v1.10.1).\r\n\r\n**Attempted Solutions:**\r\n1)\tThe first tests were performed using the stock on-board MS5611 barometer with no shielding. The flight performance was fine but produced noticeable dips upon maneuvering in any direction. \r\n2)\tThe issue  https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/10058 suggested shielding the barometer, and adjusting the EKF2_BARO_NSE, EKF2_PCOEF_%%%, EKF2_BCOEF_%%%, and EKF2_DRAG NOISE parameters. Shielding the barometer in an indirectly ported enclosure did not produce noticeable differences. (in either data or performance). Adding open-cell foam around the PX4 inside the enclosure also did not produce noticeable differences. Moving the barometer very far away from the propellers did not produce noticeable differences.\r\n3)\tAfter shielding and isolation were tested and had no effect on the problem, the suggested parameters began to be changed but shielding with enclosure and foam was kept for the remaining test. Setting the XN, XP, YN, and YP EKF2_PCOEFs to their minimum value of -.5 very slightly reduced the dip (10-30cm out of 1-3m). \r\n4)\tAfter PCOEFs were ineffectual, the BCOEFs were next to be altered. A theoretical ballistic coefficient was calculated for this aircraft using the drag coefficient of a flat-plate, the mass of the aircraft, and the area of the central plate. The calculated value was 23.96kg/m^2 (1kg/m^2 lower than default). The ballistic coefficient parameter was altered from minimum to maximum values. The EFK2_drag.innovations[0:1] were examined after each flight but did not change in RMS value. EKF2 Replay was attempted using JMavSim on a Windows 10 machine but errors were thrown upon completion of the documentation steps and replay never worked. Changing BCOEFs had little to no effect on the EKF2 innovations for both drag and wind estimation.\r\n5)\tThe last of the suggested parameters was EKF2_BARO_NSE. Raising EKF2_BARO_NSE to a value of 5m improved flight performance and reduced dips while maneuvering. This is NOT a solution to the problem as all it does is transition estimation authority from to the barometer to the GPS. The entire intent of this testing is to have consistent altitude performance even without GPS assistance (to fly in buildings and structures) therefore this is not the most desirable solution.\r\n6)\tAfter the above parameters failed to solve the problem, the EKF2_HGT_MODE was changed from barometer to GPS. This stopped the dip from occurring but once again is not a solution. After GPS was used, a downward-facing LIDAR was used with range-aid enabled without it being the primary height sensor and with range-aid and as the primary height sensor. Both of these removed the dip while maneuvering and followed terrain well. These too are undesired solutions due to limited LIDAR range and the possibility of ground-based objects messing up the LIDAR altitude estimation.\r\n7)\tThe next series of testing began with an external barometer/GPS from Zubax enabled via UAVCAN. This also featured the MS5611 chip and yielded the same results as the on-board MS5611 for all of the above tests. This GPS was also enclosed in the Zubax designed enclosure with open cell foam in the barometer enclosure (inside the overall enclosure). With UAVCAN enabled, both the external barometer and the external GPS were used as the primary GPS and barometer but did not produce noticeable differences in flight performance.\r\n8)\tNo other types of barometers were supported in v1.10.1 so v1.11.0-beta2 was used for the rest of the testing. The v1.11.0-beta2 code was altered to enable the driver for the BMP388 acquired from Adafruit. The MS5611 driver was also disabled to ensure that the BMP388 would be used for pressure-height data and not the on-board sensor. The PIDs for the rate, attitude, and XY- position controllers were able to be tuned to achieve the desired performance. The Z-position/velocity controller gains were left at default. Hover flight could be achieved as expected however, when a breeze blew the craft would gain altitude and not settle back to the set-point. The second log of the 3-4min flight is the best example of this. No control input would be given and the craft would gain altitude at the maximum allowed vertical speed (2m/s, default = 3m/s). The P and I values of the controller were reduced to close-to or just above the minimum allowed values (to create a sluggish and under-tuned controller) and still the craft would ascend at maximum vertical speed in a slight cross-breeze (2-5mph). For the end of the flight, the rise in altitude was partially counteracted by a downward RC command but almost full-stick down was commanded before the aircraft consistently began to descend.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**  \r\nI hypothesize that both flight abnormalities are caused by the pressure changes across the barometer. That being said, all tested barometers were a fully enclosed as they could have been without rendering them inoperable. My second hypothesis is that the altitude fusion in the EKF2 does not handle these barometer fluctuations well. The same craft flown with a DJI A3 controller does not have these problems when flown under the same conditions (wind, maneuvers, poor GPS environment, etc.). These logs and descriptions hopefully show problems with dynamic pressure handling (either craft moving in static air or air moving over static craft) that Pixhawk 4 has. This problem effects AltHold, PosHold, and Loiter flight modes and mission performance in many different scenarios and its significant diminishment or removal would make PX4 based systems more useful and versatile.

The drone lost 45m of altitude before the quadchute could stabilise it (luckily we transitioned at 50m altitude). \r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nIncrease the open loop transition duration if it

the bug**\r\nRunning PX4 1.10:\r\n\r\nBattery 1 shows correct voltage, and battery 2 shows incorrect voltage in QGC (and in mavlink-messages).\r\nBattery 2's lower-than-expected voltage is leading to low battery-percentage situations.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-06-09 14-33-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10667120/84191362-af3d4300-aa98-11ea-8847-7bd04822856a.png)\r\n\r\nWhen connecting up a Drotek p3 pro with the drotek power management unit (Dual battery monitors) - we are getting two battery (Analog ADC voltage and current) measurements in PX4 1.10 - which is as expected with the dual input of the p3 pro and dual measurements of the PMU.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10667120/84183652-8616b580-aa8c-11ea-865b-b1e67825e611.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![drotek-powerunit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10667120/84183955-daba3080-aa8c-11ea-8f7a-5eeef41365dd.png)\r\n\r\nAfter setting up the offsets/scaling factors correctly (and measuring the power-monitor outputs to be equal with voltmeter)\r\nThe first battery's measurements are correct - However, the second battery's measurements are always measuring a much lower voltage. The difference can typically be 49V for battery1, on a fresh 12S lipo - versus 41V for battery2. Switching power monitor inputs 1/2 does not alter the results - measurements stay at same values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nDrotek p3 pro FC\r\nDrotek power management pro connected to power port 1 and 2 on Drotek p3 pro FC.\r\nSet scaling factors according to manufacturer. \r\nApply voltage to drone \r\nApply voltmeter to Power-manager individual outputs and verify same input voltage for autopilot ADCs.\r\nTurn on drone and QGC should show two batteries.\r\n\r\nBattery 1 will show voltage equal to actual battery voltage(Vref & Vbat1).\r\nBattery 2 will show a lower-than-battery-voltage (Vbat2).\r\n\r\nThrough adjusting voltages (Vref), we've found that there is always a multiplication factor of 1.20 between the measured voltages (Vbat1/Vbat2).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nBattery 1 should show correct voltage (~50v for a full 12s)\r\nBattery 2 should show correct voltage (~50v for a full 12s)\r\n\r\nBattery percentage estimate should be stable, and ideally there should be a description of how the system handles the two batteries. Especially considering the 1.10 release doesn't have parameters to set up a second battery measurement, with its capacity, resistance etc.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nNo flight logs done, all ground testing. Can provide ground testing values if strictly needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween multiple vehicle's there also seems to be a difference in which battery is chosen as the \"main\" battery, or how weighting is applied between the two batteries - because the battery % estimate in QGC drops much faster for one vehicle versus another, with exact same HW setup and batteries. (Yes, also when switching the physical batteries between the two vehicles)\r\n\r\nEither fixing measurement on Bat2 so that it is correct, or removing the measurement completely would solve the issue.\r\n\r\n@dagar - Here's the issue discussed on slack.
