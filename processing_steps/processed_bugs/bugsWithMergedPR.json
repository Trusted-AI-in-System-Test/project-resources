Sometimes almost all\r\naltitude difference was already covered during\r\nthe turn instead of going diagonally.\r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Make the entire L1 distance and intersection calculation 3D\r\n- Refactor ...\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Multicopter altitude change sometimes not linear between two waypoints\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSimulation testing procedure:\r\n\r\n1.

The proposed solution is to only fuse a fake yaw measurement when the yaw variance of the estimator is too large (i.e.: larger than its initialization value).\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- do not run the mag selection/reset/fusion logic when the mag is inhibited\r\n- stop the mag fusion when the mag is constantly inhibited, this prevents having the mag fusion flag set while the fusion is not occurring for a long time.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL test: mag type none, takeoff in alt mode, move to init yaw. After a couple of seconds, change the gyro bias to 0.1 rad/s\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\nThe gyro bias takes time to estimate and during that time, the drone makes a violent toilet bowl spiral. It ends up stopping navigation and falls back to alt mode after 2 yaw resets.\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=9619a774-677a-43e3-96c7-6dc710d1828e\r\n![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20221229172559](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822839/209981336-b4934b10-fb4b-41fa-97a1-82944e3819eb.png)\r\n\r\nthis PR:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e8694d1e-8798-4734-89fb-fd7e663bdfd5\r\nThe gyro bias is learned rapidly and a slight toilet bowl is enough to correct the yaw estimate properly.\r\n![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20221229170529](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822839/209981905-c5c5cdc0-7109-42d3-aaf9-4b54d37d02a0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- unit tests for the mag inhibition\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "\r\n## Describe problem solved by this pull request\r\nThis is to address what was reported here: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1277934841\r\n\r\nWhat I think was going on:\r\n- RTL triggered a couple of times, and each time it was above the return altitude, so didnâ€™t have to climb. In the v1.13 RTL logic, as pointed out [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1284454859), the mission_item.loiter_radius field wasn't filled, and it just kept using it as initialized. \r\n- The initialization happens in the constructor, and it initializes it to `_navigator->get_loiter_radius()`, which itself just gets the value of `_param_nav_loiter_rad`. At this moment, the params are though not yet fetched (happens [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/c267cf71c3aa57fbbe544d02f3b25650f029384d/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L151))\r\n- in the [flight](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=4a466655-3c02-4f78-ab9e-1d90bca4b8e3) linked in the above mentioned issue , the initialisation value of it seems to have been 3.9e32, which was then passed through to the `position_setpoint_current.loiter_radius` (there is only a check for if(>0)), and the vehicle started on it's voyage around the solar system\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/197223431-d4a5a3c5-33ee-4655-8974-32d73cfc8abb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe your solution\r\nOn current main we by accident fixed this particular issue already,[ as we explicitly set the loiter_radius](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/ed558e199faab703ea3fb352db16512981fdb7ec/src/modules/navigator/rtl.cpp#L407) in every state of the RTL state machine. This wasn't the case in v1.13, but I guess we should back port it.\r\nAdditionally we should change the initialization of mission_item. I propose here to initialize to 0, which is considered as \"invalid\" before and not used in then (checks for ISFINITE and >FLT_EPS). \r\nI did the same for mission_item.acceptance_radius. \r\n\r\n## Describe possible alternatives\r\n- do we have a way to update the params before the constructor is called?\r\n- should we initialize `mission_item` fields consistently to NAN instead of some to NAN (currently yaw, lat, lon), and some to 0, and some not at all (e.g. altitude). And is this initialization in the constructor even needed?\r\n\r\n",

This can lead to unexpected deviations during back transitions. And as the altitude is ultimately controlled (fix) by the MC module the spiralling down doesn't actually spiral down anyway... Also note that if you have a small value on FW_CLMBOUT_DIFF you can be affected even when the next WP is at the same altitude if the drone gets a lot of altitude during back transition due to pitching up.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nDeactivate the loitering logic during transitions. \r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n\\-\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nFound on two different real quadplanes, and I was able to reproduce it on SITL.\r\n\r\nReal flight on v1.12.1: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=2f6a1c96-eabb-4576-abb1-a99b716f6c67\r\n\r\nSITL tests with attached mission file [test BT deviations.zip](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/files/7279541/test.BT.deviations.zip):\r\n\r\nmaster, FW_AIRSPD_TRIM = 19, FW_L1_PERIOD = 25 and NAV_LOITER_RAD = 50: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=79cadeb1-27bc-4c4c-88c4-7ded26c0a430\r\n\r\nmaster, default parameters: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6c1b368b-a435-4868-a856-159d68da926c\r\nInterestingly there is no deviation even though the logic still triggers.

This makes more sense since the mixers actually allow you to give -1 flap commands. If we want to prevent this behavior, IMO we need to add an explicit mode for it rather than secretly scaling this inside the attitude controller.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nTested by flying a plane model in Gazebo SITL\r\n```\r\nmake px4_sitl gazebo_plane\r\n```\r\nFlown using a virtual joystick on QGroundControl.

(@dagar @sfuhrer @RomanBapst )\r\n\r\n**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nEli Vigdorchik ran into an undesired external quadchute during one of his test flights as reported on slack (https://px4.slack.com/archives/C39C4E709/p1622652580039900). Log here: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=26c65922-793b-4bad-88fa-86f58b97eb82 . For some reason Param2 of the command is set to 3, triggering the Quadchute instead of doing a normal back transition during RTL. I was able to reproduce in SITL on v1.12.0-beta and on master. I guess the issue is a badly initialized / old value of param2 floating around somewhere.\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=efaae0f0-a8a8-494c-b32d-6e041689836f\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e177614d-a4c1-4ebf-97ca-6ed6fb8cf420\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nExplicitly set Param2 to 0.0f in all occurrences where a normal BT is desired (I searched for all occurrences of *DO_VTOL_TRANSITION in the code).\r\n\r\nI also added a check on NANs. If param2 is a NAN, then _immediate_transition is false too.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nSame procedure, i.e. Position mode flight with RTL triggered over QGC:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7cc61dad-7145-4e81-9ee3-f7c84dd04ef9\r\n\r\nI also tried manual transitions, transitions over QGC, missions with VTOL Land and normal Land items, `commander transition` and switching to Land mode via QGC. I couldn't provoke any external quadchutes. Did I miss another option to get into back transition?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFollow up of https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16691\r\n",

    "body": "**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nPreviously, rover vehicles were not able to handle Takeoff waypoints. The behavior when a takeoff waypoint was passed to a rover vehicle was:\r\n- The vehicle would not move since the waypoint was too close\r\n- The takeoff waypoint would not get accepted since rovers are not able to climb and reach the altitude\r\n\r\nI think it might be obvious that one \"should not\" pass takeoff waypoints to a vehicle. However, QGroundControl only lets you plan a mission that starts with a takeoff waypoint. While this should also be an improvement on the QGC side, I think it is still useful to handle this case on the vehicle side so that the vehicle can still progress with the mission even with a takeoff waypoint\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThis adds a special case when handling takeoff waypoints for rover vehicles. The acceptance radius is set to only consider horizontal distance to the waypoint, if the vehicle type is rover.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\n- This was tested in SITL gazebo, with the rover model.\r\n```\r\nmake px4_sitl gazebo_rover\r\n```\r\nThis log shows a full mission successfully finished starting with a Takeoff waypoint and finished with a RTL: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=25fe983b-44d0-4a11-a7c2-2ab9662c35d4\r\n",

    "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13693",
    "body": "This is an attempt to fix an issue which can seen in this [log file](https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=47b2b562-bd40-4137-ae46-ef34d17d5f21)\r\nWhat happens is that the VTOL starts to descend after the back-transition prior to arriving at the actual waypoint. This can be very dangerous e.g. when the vehicle is pushed away from the land waypoint during the transition. It will then start to descend while moving toward the land waypoint.\r\nThe behavior should be that the vehicle keeps altitude until it has reached the landing waypoint.\r\n\r\nI have first reproduced this behavior on 1.9.2 but it only happened once in a while and appeared to be a race condition. I figured out that in some cases the navigator was using the acceptance radius from the fixed wing position controller in order to determine if the landing waypoint has been reached. This is a bug as the fixed wing acceptance radius can be very large and should not be used during hover.\r\nI believe this fix here solves the issue on 1.9.2.\r\n\r\nHowever, when testing the same fix on master I figured that there is a new problem in master.\r\nFor some reason the altitude setpoint of the position_setpoint_triplet.current is set to a very low value (6m) right at the start of the back-transition. This value is then further used as altitude setpoint during the horizonal movement during the landing waypoint. I'm not sure what causes this but the effect is again that the vehicle descends while moving towards the land waypoint. This needs further investigation.\r\n\r\nThis can easily be reproduced in SITL using the standard vtol model.\r\nI'm further uploading the mission file which can be used to reproduce the problem. You might need to change the file extension to .plan\r\n[vtol_mission.LOG](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3932587/vtol_mission.LOG)\r\n\r\n",

Not only altitude, but also pitch and throttle can thus oscillate significantly. We observed this during a recent test flight.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2565608/42387985-53c6343e-8144-11e8-86d2-a42aecc4c5c0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLog file from SITL where this can be seen: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=f18c45ab-622e-4b1d-9819-03cfb06af2b5 . Here, after t=3:20 the true altitude setpoint is still the same as before t=2:20 (i.e. 630m AMSL) but the FOH logic just wrongly sets it to 660m and adds slight oscillations on top. The exact amount of oscillations depends on waypoint distance, altitude difference etc, but i have seen altitude ref oscillations of up to 30m, resulting in full pitch up/down of the aircraft.\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\nSee the commit for the location of the code where this is happening. Essentially, every time that the loiter radius of any loiter WP is larger than the acceptance radius calculated from the L1 turn distance, then the Navigator FOH would _not_ consider the waypoint reached and would thus not stop modifying the current altitude setpoint. This leads to the oscillations or offsets in the altitude reference. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nIf in any loiter mode, consider the loiter radius times a factor of 1.2 (same as for the waypoint_reached logic [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L217) as the acceptance radius. Tested in SITL, which should be sufficient for this case.\r\n\r\n@acfloria @ryanjAA @antiheavy FYI\r\n@dagar Made this PR as a quick hotfix independently of your PR at https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/8883/files which supposedly also fixes this but is much larger and where it is more uncertain when this would be merged.",

    "title": "Fix uncontrolled height gain in hold/loiter mode",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8418",
    "body": "This fixes the height gain bug that occurs when using hold/loiter mode after taking off without GPS and gaining it's use in-flight. Reported by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8400\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a bug causing the  height in the mavlink global position relative_alt message to be AMSL instead of height above takeoff location if GPS checks pass after takeoff.\r\n\r\nThe practice of allowing use of hold and position change commands via GCS inputs after a non-GPS takeoff has wider implications. In such a scenario, both RTL and geofencing are disabled, the user may not be aware of this, and unlike flying using stick inputs, it would be easy for the user to inadvertently fly the vehicle to a range where comms are lost or recovery using stick demands is impossible. \r\n\r\nThis has been tested in SITL using the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1) Modify the SITL startup script to inhibit GPS lock by adding 'gpssim set -t 0' at the end\r\n2) Run 'make posix_sitl_default gazebo' and wait for the ekf to initialise\r\n3) Select 'altitud'e mode on QGC, arm and takeoff using throttle stick\r\n4) Enable GPS lock using 'gpssim set -t 3'\r\n5) Wait for EKF GPS fusion to start\r\n6) Select 'hold' mode on QGC and command a positive altitude change using the slider and confirm completion\r\n7) Command a position change on QGC using the 'fly to click' feature and confirm completion\r\n8) Command a negative altitude change using the slider and confirm completion\r\n9) Command  a landing at current location.\r\n\r\nLog file here: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=afea809a-e7fe-463c-bfe7-ef6296064330",

    "html_url": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8374",
    "body": "The preflight checking of ekf2 health status as currently implemented in the commander has a two main vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\nIf GPS arming checks had been disabled via the COM_ARM_WO_GPS parameter, then this was also bypassing the ekf2 health checks.\r\nThe ekf2Check() function in the commander is only called once per mode change or arming request which means that the status is a snapshot of the EKF output and does not handle transient errors or noise well.\r\nThis PR improves the continuous ekf2 pre-arm checks and publishes the result as a boolean on the estimator_status message, which is then checked by the ekf2Check() function in the commander.\r\nIt also removes the bypass of ekf2Check()\r\n\r\nPreflight checking changes:\r\n\r\n- Separate the vertical and horizontal checks for use by local position validity reporting\r\n- Add checking of yaw using a decaying envelope filter to the horizontal checks.\r\n- Publish the check result to estimator_status topic.\r\n\r\nLog from testing of preflight checks here: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=1bc435b7-86e3-4c73-82a5-a98c77949a3d. A magnet was used to cause large changes in magnetic yaw and fail preflight checks whilst attempting to arm.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-27 at 1 29 43 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3596952/33248223-073adfea-d378-11e7-85c6-472212894ea8.png)\r\n\r\nIf a RW vehicle takeoff off with a large yaw error, the EKF will start to reject the GPS data due to the inconsistency with the  INS solution. This combined with the position controller can cause an uncontrolled high speed flight condition. When this occurs, the EKF reports the navigation output as invalid, however after reset back to GPS, the navigation solution will be reported as valid again for a varying interval. This causes an interaction with the commander failsafe resulting in unpredictable transitions in and out of the failsafe mode. The solution implemented by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/39134325740a193fd755763e52faffe030073e5f\r\n\r\n- Checks for loss of navigation for up to 30 seconds after takeoff or until  a horizontal speed of 5 m/s has been achieved.\r\n- If the vehicle is not landed and the check is active, then the navigation is declared as failed if the velocity innovations fail for a continuous period of 1 second.\r\n- This will cause the local and global position and velocity validity to be latched false to prevent unsafe use of position control modes.\r\n- An emergency message 'CRITICAL NAVIGATION FAILURE - CHECK SENSOR CALIBRATION' is output to console and mavlink if the failsafe is activated.\r\n\r\nTest log generated using SITL with  90 degree misaligned compass data here: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6aa3a650-a65a-499a-a4ed-9ab287e9e764",
