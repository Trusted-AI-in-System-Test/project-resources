						<td>PositionSmoothing: fix corner altitude bug</td>
						<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22331</td>
						<td>### Solved Problem
We got multiple reports that the altitude profile between two waypoints is not a diagonal line but changes altitude much quicker when leaving the previous waypoint and getting much flatter after that.

During a round corner the L1 distance calculation
was only done in 2D and the z-axis coordinate
was directly coming from the next waypoint.
This lead to an unpredictable altitude profile
between two waypoints. Sometimes almost all
altitude difference was already covered during
the turn instead of going diagonally.

Fixes #{Github issue ID}

### Solution
- Make the entire L1 distance and intersection calculation 3D
- Refactor ...

### Changelog Entry
```
Bugfix: Multicopter altitude change sometimes not linear between two waypoints
```

### Test coverage
Simulation testing procedure:

1. Command to test: `PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=100 make px4_sitl jmavsim`
1. [Load plan file](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/PlanView/PlanView.html#file) for jMAVsim location through QGC: [rounded_altitude_change.plan](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/files/13283004/rounded_altitude_change.plan.txt)

I still need to verify the 2D only case with no valid altitude works as expected.

### Solved Problem
When not using a mag (e.g.: after yaw emergency or mag type "none"), a yaw error isn't properly corrected even in presence of a large acceleration an a GNSS observation.

### Solution
Constantly fusing a zero yaw innovation makes the filter too confident about its yaw estimate and doesn't correct itself anymore. The proposed solution is to only fuse a fake yaw measurement when the yaw variance of the estimator is too large (i.e.: larger than its initialization value).

Other changes:
- do not run the mag selection/reset/fusion logic when the mag is inhibited
- stop the mag fusion when the mag is constantly inhibited, this prevents having the mag fusion flag set while the fusion is not occurring for a long time.

### Test coverage
SITL test: mag type none, takeoff in alt mode, move to init yaw. After a couple of seconds, change the gyro bias to 0.1 rad/s

before:
The gyro bias takes time to estimate and during that time, the drone makes a violent toilet bowl spiral. It ends up stopping navigation and falls back to alt mode after 2 yaw resets.

The gyro bias is learned rapidly and a slight toilet bowl is enough to correct the yaw estimate properly.

						<td>Fix invalid offboard setpoints for fw pos control</td>
						<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/20669</td>
						<td>### Solved Problem
This commit fixes a regression that caused problems when trying to use offboard control with fixedwings (or VTOLs in fixedwing mode)

The problem was that all offboard setpoints were considered invalid in offboard mode:

### Solution
This was a regression introduced by https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19942, where the valid flag in position_setpoint_triplet was no longer being used and the offboard logic was left out.

## Describe problem solved by this pull request
This is to address what was reported here: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1277934841

What I think was going on:
- RTL triggered a couple of times, and each time it was above the return altitude, so didnâ€™t have to climb. In the v1.13 RTL logic, as pointed out [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1284454859), the mission_item.loiter_radius field wasn't filled, and it just kept using it as initialized. 
- The initialization happens in the constructor, and it initializes it to `_navigator->get_loiter_radius()`, which itself just gets the value of `_param_nav_loiter_rad`. At this moment, the params are though not yet fetched (happens [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/c267cf71c3aa57fbbe544d02f3b25650f029384d/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L151))
- in the [flight](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=4a466655-3c02-4f78-ab9e-1d90bca4b8e3) linked in the above mentioned issue , the initialisation value of it seems to have been 3.9e32, which was then passed through to the `position_setpoint_current.loiter_radius` (there is only a check for if(>0)), and the vehicle started on it's voyage around the solar system


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/197223431-d4a5a3c5-33ee-4655-8974-32d73cfc8abb.png)


## Describe your solution
On current main we by accident fixed this particular issue already,[ as we explicitly set the loiter_radius](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/ed558e199faab703ea3fb352db16512981fdb7ec/src/modules/navigator/rtl.cpp#L407) in every state of the RTL state machine. This wasn't the case in v1.13, but I guess we should back port it.
Additionally we should change the initialization of mission_item. I propose here to initialize to 0, which is considered as "invalid" before and not used in then (checks for ISFINITE and >FLT_EPS). 
I did the same for mission_item.acceptance_radius. 

## Describe possible alternatives
- do we have a way to update the params before the constructor is called?
- should we initialize `mission_item` fields consistently to NAN instead of some to NAN (currently yaw, lat, lon), and some to 0, and some not at all (e.g. altitude). And is this initialization in the constructor even needed?

						<td>Enable offboard actuator setpoints</td>

						<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
Sending actuator setpoints directly from a onboard computer provides a useful way to execute open loop manuevers which is useful for system identification.

While previous to https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16739  it was possible to send actuator commands using the `https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#SET_ACTUATOR_CONTROL_TARGET` mavlink message, this is no longer working since it is not understood as a valid offboard mode.

						<td>VTOL Fix back transition devaitions</td>
						<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18350</td>
						<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
I found a bug with back transitions that was introduced with I think https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16499. 

If you set the next WP after the back transition to a different altitude the drone can enter a "spiralling down" mode (set here: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L842-L850). This can lead to unexpected deviations during back transitions. And as the altitude is ultimately controlled (fix) by the MC module the spiralling down doesn't actually spiral down anyway... Also note that if you have a small value on FW_CLMBOUT_DIFF you can be affected even when the next WP is at the same altitude if the drone gets a lot of altitude during back transition due to pitching up.

**Describe your solution**
Deactivate the loitering logic during transitions. 

**Describe possible alternatives**

**Test data / coverage**
Found on two different real quadplanes, and I was able to reproduce it on SITL.

Real flight on v1.12.1: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=2f6a1c96-eabb-4576-abb1-a99b716f6c67

SITL tests with attached mission file [test BT deviations.zip](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/files/7279541/test.BT.deviations.zip):

master, FW_AIRSPD_TRIM = 19, FW_L1_PERIOD = 25 and NAV_LOITER_RAD = 50: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=79cadeb1-27bc-4c4c-88c4-7ded26c0a430

master, default parameters: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6c1b368b-a435-4868-a856-159d68da926c
Interestingly there is no deviation even though the logic still triggers. I don't understand why the deviation doesn't happen on default parameters, must be something particular with the FW loitering logic. Check `position_controller_status.type`, it goes to 2, showing that the loitering logic is triggered.

This PR: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=ef558a1a-2c2c-461f-a781-645a3ad2e121 
`position_controller_status.type` = 0 throughout, no deviation.

						<td>Fix flaps being deployed in manual flight modes for fixedwing</td>
						<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18035</td>
						<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
For fixedwings, there were different flap scalings deployed between auto modes and manual flight modes, resulting in the flaps always being deployed halfway in manual flight modes.

- In manual flight modes(stabilized, manual), zero flap input was mapped to flap command 0.5
- In auto modes(mission, hold), zero flap command was mapped to flap command 0.0

**Describe your solution**
This PR removes the special scaling in manual flight modes, so that the flap does not get deployed when switching fixed wing aircraft between manual and auto modes.

This should not influence flaps being deployed in auto modes.

**Describe possible alternatives**
By removing the scaling, we are assuming that flap commands range from [-1, 1]. This makes more sense since the mixers actually allow you to give -1 flap commands. If we want to prevent this behavior, IMO we need to add an explicit mode for it rather than secretly scaling this inside the attitude controller.

**Test data / coverage**
Tested by flying a plane model in Gazebo SITL
```

**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
Eli Vigdorchik ran into an undesired external quadchute during one of his test flights as reported on slack (https://px4.slack.com/archives/C39C4E709/p1622652580039900). Log here: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=26c65922-793b-4bad-88fa-86f58b97eb82 . For some reason Param2 of the command is set to 3, triggering the Quadchute instead of doing a normal back transition during RTL. I was able to reproduce in SITL on v1.12.0-beta and on master. I guess the issue is a badly initialized / old value of param2 floating around somewhere.

https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e177614d-a4c1-4ebf-97ca-6ed6fb8cf420

**Describe your solution**
Explicitly set Param2 to 0.0f in all occurrences where a normal BT is desired (I searched for all occurrences of *DO_VTOL_TRANSITION in the code).

I also added a check on NANs. If param2 is a NAN, then _immediate_transition is false too.

**Describe possible alternatives**

**Test data / coverage**
Same procedure, i.e. Position mode flight with RTL triggered over QGC:
https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7cc61dad-7145-4e81-9ee3-f7c84dd04ef9

I also tried manual transitions, transitions over QGC, missions with VTOL Land and normal Land items, `commander transition` and switching to Land mode via QGC. I couldn't provoke any external quadchutes. Did I miss another option to get into back transition?

							<td>vtol_att_control: occasional tailsitter forward transition failure</td>
							<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17310</td>
							<td>
Tailsitter VTOLs very occasionally gets stuck with zero roll and pitch angle in multicopter mode after
a forward transition command is issued.

Log files with the transition failure:
https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d3c74285-5ae5-430d-a1bd-1b4e6de13938
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=8d86e43c-5570-4480-9123-7e25669c5463

In the above logs you can see the pitch and roll sp set to zero during the forward transition. 

This very rare behavior is triggered by the following events:
1> a forward transition is triggered either in auto or manual mode.
2> in the vtol_att_control main loop, if multicopter and fixed wing attitude setpoints are not updated, transition state is not updated
3> the commander changes the vehicle status to transition mode.
4> multicopter pos controller initiated  Transition flight task. This results in zero roll and pitch setpoint due to zero acceleration setpoint
5> now vtol_att_control executes and updates the transition state. Specifically, _q_trans_start and _q_trans_sp are set with zero roll and pitch sp
6> tilt is evaluated to be NaN, despite _q_trans_sp being normalized. This happens for 25% of all yaw angles when using float datatype. This can be
   verified using the matrix library
7> once tilt is evaluated to be NaN, _q_trans_sp is never updated again and is stuck in this state for ever.

This has been fixed by constraining the cos(tilt) within +1 to -1 range
Further, _q_trans_start and _q_trans_sp are immedietly initialized after a transition event is triggered.

									<td>Handle takeoff waypoints for rover</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16297</td>
									<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
Previously, rover vehicles were not able to handle Takeoff waypoints. The behavior when a takeoff waypoint was passed to a rover vehicle was:
- The vehicle would not move since the waypoint was too close
- The takeoff waypoint would not get accepted since rovers are not able to climb and reach the altitude

I think it might be obvious that one "should not" pass takeoff waypoints to a vehicle. However, QGroundControl only lets you plan a mission that starts with a takeoff waypoint. While this should also be an improvement on the QGC side, I think it is still useful to handle this case on the vehicle side so that the vehicle can still progress with the mission even with a takeoff waypoint

**Describe your solution**
This adds a special case when handling takeoff waypoints for rover vehicles. The acceptance radius is set to only consider horizontal distance to the waypoint, if the vehicle type is rover.

**Test data / coverage**
- This was tested in SITL gazebo, with the rover model.
```
make px4_sitl gazebo_rover
```

Before this PR, VT_F_TR_OL_TM would silently reduce VT_TRANS_MIN_TM when VT_F_TR_OL_TM was smaller. This almost caused a crash on our quadplane because the (non-airspeed) transition was considered finished way too early. The drone lost 45m of altitude before the quadchute could stabilise it (luckily we transitioned at 50m altitude). 

**Describe your solution**
Increase the open loop transition duration if it is smaller than the minimum transition duration and notify the user.

									<td>mc_pos_control: fix takeoff ramp gets amended by feed-forward</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14821</td>
									<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
I found an issue with the takeoff ramp when real world testing https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/14749 on the Holybro QAV250. But I found the issue is independent of that pr.

The thrust doesn't ramp nicely anymore like it was designed but depending on stick input can go up and down unexpectedly during the ramp up. This can lead to early land detection if the thrust goes up high enough and then back down because the ramp is not yet high enough.

The problem is: Because the takeoff ramp is a vertical velocity limit ramp for the nice user experience but the acceleration feed-forward can add on top of the output and depending on trajectory generation result in unwanted thrust changes during the ramp.

**Describe your solution**
I suppress the vertical acceleration feed-forward during the ramp.

**Test data / coverage**
It's reproducable in SITL with the correct configuration:
`MPC_TKO_RAMP_T` 5, `MPC_JERK_MAX` 20
1. Switch to position mode
2. Arm
3. Fully rise the throttle stick

									<td>navigator: do not use fixed wing acceptance radius if in rotary wingâ€¦</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13693</td>
									<td>This is an attempt to fix an issue which can seen in this [log file](https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=47b2b562-bd40-4137-ae46-ef34d17d5f21)
What happens is that the VTOL starts to descend after the back-transition prior to arriving at the actual waypoint. This can be very dangerous e.g. when the vehicle is pushed away from the land waypoint during the transition. It will then start to descend while moving toward the land waypoint.
The behavior should be that the vehicle keeps altitude until it has reached the landing waypoint.

I have first reproduced this behavior on 1.9.2 but it only happened once in a while and appeared to be a race condition. I figured out that in some cases the navigator was using the acceptance radius from the fixed wing position controller in order to determine if the landing waypoint has been reached. This is a bug as the fixed wing acceptance radius can be very large and should not be used during hover.
I believe this fix here solves the issue on 1.9.2.

However, when testing the same fix on master I figured that there is a new problem in master.
For some reason the altitude setpoint of the position_setpoint_triplet.current is set to a very low value (6m) right at the start of the back-transition. This value is then further used as altitude setpoint during the horizonal movement during the landing waypoint. I'm not sure what causes this but the effect is again that the vehicle descends while moving towards the land waypoint. This needs further investigation.

This can easily be reproduced in SITL using the standard vtol model.
I'm further uploading the mission file which can be used to reproduce the problem. You might need to change the file extension to .plan

									<td>PositionControl: tiny minimal thrust length</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11987</td>
									<td>**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**
To be able to still infer the direction of the thrust vector we limit it to a minimal length even if `MPC_THR_MIN` is set to zero. The parameter `MPC_THR_MIN` already needs to be forced to 0 so this is really an extreme corner case.

Note: This is a hotfix for certain specific applications. The direction of the thrust vector in this corner case is very likely to get into the tilt limit which is generally undesired.

**Test data / coverage**
SITL tests:
- **Without** a tiny minimal thrust added in this PR flying unsmoothed position control with `MPC_THR_MIN` set to 0 and demanding a downwards step which results in hard downwards acceleration:
https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=4ef6a4cf-359e-4561-adbb-5a93387a981e
thrust goes to (0,0,0) attitude roll and pitch go to level.

It's desirable to keep the attitude information in the thrust vector and therefore it should never be exactly (0,0,0).

A remaining problem that existed before is that if e.g. to accelerate downwards very hard the thrust vector in z-axis direction gets zero (which means demanded idle thrust and hence almost freefall) the desired attitude should not tilt extremely just because the result of the velocity control is 90 degree tilt in the direction of the horizontal error.

I disucussed with @bresch that it would makes sense to at least not demand the direction of the thrust vector to change faster than the maximal rate to rate controller will execute in the end. Otherwise we know beforehands it will result in a large unfeasible error.

									<td>RTL - Skip descend state in "Return then land immediately" mode</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11913</td>
									<td>**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**
During RTL, some users (thanks @bkueng ) reported that the behavior of the drone during the RTL final descent is weird: it accelerates and decelerates several times instead of simply performing a "land".
I discovered that this was caused by the intermediate waypoint placed by RTL between "descend" and "land.
This PR simply adds a shortcut in the state machine to directly go to land mode and skip that waypoint if RTL is configured as "Return home, then land immediately".

As seen in the graph below, the drone reaches down speed of 1m/s then slows down to reach the "end of RTL descend" then accelerate to reach down speed and reduces speed to reach a land speed of 0.7m/s.

@dagar I removed the check for negative airspeed and also removed the slew rate on the airspeed scaling.
I think normally we should not have the situation where the airspeed valid flag toggles between true and false so I don't quite see the point of the slew rate. Furthermore, the slew rate could have hidden this problem in the first place.
I'm happy to discuss this if you feel strong about it.

									<td>Navigator: Fix fixed-wing first order altitude hold</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9850</td>
									<td>**Issue**
Navigator's fixed-wing first-order altitude hold (FOH) is currently causing altitude reference oscillations when in any LOITER mode. See screenshot below. Not only altitude, but also pitch and throttle can thus oscillate significantly. We observed this during a recent test flight.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2565608/42387985-53c6343e-8144-11e8-86d2-a42aecc4c5c0.png)


Log file from SITL where this can be seen: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=f18c45ab-622e-4b1d-9819-03cfb06af2b5 . Here, after t=3:20 the true altitude setpoint is still the same as before t=2:20 (i.e. 630m AMSL) but the FOH logic just wrongly sets it to 660m and adds slight oscillations on top. The exact amount of oscillations depends on waypoint distance, altitude difference etc, but i have seen altitude ref oscillations of up to 30m, resulting in full pitch up/down of the aircraft.

**Analysis**
See the commit for the location of the code where this is happening. Essentially, every time that the loiter radius of any loiter WP is larger than the acceptance radius calculated from the L1 turn distance, then the Navigator FOH would _not_ consider the waypoint reached and would thus not stop modifying the current altitude setpoint. This leads to the oscillations or offsets in the altitude reference. 

**Solution**
If in any loiter mode, consider the loiter radius times a factor of 1.2 (same as for the waypoint_reached logic [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L217) as the acceptance radius. Tested in SITL, which should be sufficient for this case.

@acfloria @ryanjAA @antiheavy FYI

Current ekf2 internal prediction time step is 8 msec and the default value of EKF2_ABL_LIM is 0.4 m/s/s, so the maximum delta velocity bias estimate output by the EKFis will clip at 3.2E-3 m/s using current parameter defaults.

									<td>Fix uncontrolled height gain in hold/loiter mode</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8418</td>
									<td>This fixes the height gain bug that occurs when using hold/loiter mode after taking off without GPS and gaining it's use in-flight. Reported by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8400

It also fixes a bug causing the  height in the mavlink global position relative_alt message to be AMSL instead of height above takeoff location if GPS checks pass after takeoff.

The practice of allowing use of hold and position change commands via GCS inputs after a non-GPS takeoff has wider implications. In such a scenario, both RTL and geofencing are disabled, the user may not be aware of this, and unlike flying using stick inputs, it would be easy for the user to inadvertently fly the vehicle to a range where comms are lost or recovery using stick demands is impossible. 

This has been tested in SITL using the following procedure:

1) Modify the SITL startup script to inhibit GPS lock by adding 'gpssim set -t 0' at the end
2) Run 'make posix_sitl_default gazebo' and wait for the ekf to initialise
3) Select 'altitud'e mode on QGC, arm and takeoff using throttle stick
4) Enable GPS lock using 'gpssim set -t 3'
5) Wait for EKF GPS fusion to start
6) Select 'hold' mode on QGC and command a positive altitude change using the slider and confirm completion
7) Command a position change on QGC using the 'fly to click' feature and confirm completion
8) Command a negative altitude change using the slider and confirm completion
9) Command  a landing at current location.

									<td>Fix vulnerability in pre flight checks and failsafe</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8374</td>
									<td>The preflight checking of ekf2 health status as currently implemented in the commander has a two main vulnerabilities:

If GPS arming checks had been disabled via the COM_ARM_WO_GPS parameter, then this was also bypassing the ekf2 health checks.
The ekf2Check() function in the commander is only called once per mode change or arming request which means that the status is a snapshot of the EKF output and does not handle transient errors or noise well.
This PR improves the continuous ekf2 pre-arm checks and publishes the result as a boolean on the estimator_status message, which is then checked by the ekf2Check() function in the commander.
It also removes the bypass of ekf2Check()

Preflight checking changes:

- Separate the vertical and horizontal checks for use by local position validity reporting
- Add checking of yaw using a decaying envelope filter to the horizontal checks.
- Publish the check result to estimator_status topic.

Log from testing of preflight checks here: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=1bc435b7-86e3-4c73-82a5-a98c77949a3d. A magnet was used to cause large changes in magnetic yaw and fail preflight checks whilst attempting to arm.

If a RW vehicle takeoff off with a large yaw error, the EKF will start to reject the GPS data due to the inconsistency with the  INS solution. This combined with the position controller can cause an uncontrolled high speed flight condition. When this occurs, the EKF reports the navigation output as invalid, however after reset back to GPS, the navigation solution will be reported as valid again for a varying interval. This causes an interaction with the commander failsafe resulting in unpredictable transitions in and out of the failsafe mode. The solution implemented by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/39134325740a193fd755763e52faffe030073e5f

- Checks for loss of navigation for up to 30 seconds after takeoff or until  a horizontal speed of 5 m/s has been achieved.
- If the vehicle is not landed and the check is active, then the navigation is declared as failed if the velocity innovations fail for a continuous period of 1 second.
- This will cause the local and global position and velocity validity to be latched false to prevent unsafe use of position control modes.
- An emergency message 'CRITICAL NAVIGATION FAILURE - CHECK SENSOR CALIBRATION' is output to console and mavlink if the failsafe is activated.
