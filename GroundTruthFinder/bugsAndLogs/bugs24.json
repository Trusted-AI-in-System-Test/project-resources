Z estimation does not take LIDAR measurements into account. LIDAR sometimes is reported as ok, but mostly faults with no (at least reported) recovery. Raw lidar measurements however are ok without any dropouts. \r\nI have set the fusion mask to 148 in order to disable AGL, GPS, vision Yaw and Flow as I purely rely on vision position estimates. LPE_VIS_Z and LPE_BARO I have set to maximum (to rely on LIDAR only). \r\nAs a result, I get a Z estimation that seems to rely on the accelerator measurements only.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6172","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6172/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6172/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6172/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6172","id":197542079,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTc1NDIwNzk=","number":6172,"title":"Build

We tried everithing possible but nothing happened. At some point the batteries just started to die and the plane just landed very nice in Loiter.

flying using manual_control mavlink messages\n\nWhen the ground station stops to send manual_control the rc link should go into failsafe - at the moment it is being kept active all the time resulting in fly-away.\n\nFrom my investigations:\n- mavlink_receiver (MavlinkReceiver::handle_message_manual_control) - only publishes rc input values when manual_control message arrives (it never sets rc.rc_lost to true)\n- Sensors::rc_poll() expects rc.rc_lost to be set in order to trigger failsafe\n\nI can think of 2 solutions:\n- MavlinkReceiver to implement some kind of timer on manual_control, after which rc is published with rc_lost=true (this would only be active in certain COM_RC_IN_MODE)\n- Sensors::rc_poll() to keep track of last updated rc_input and to fallback into failsafe after timeout\n\nAny views on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/5632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/5632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/5631","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/5631/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/5631/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/5631/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/5631","id":182050018,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODIwNTAwMTg=","number":5631,"title":"Fix

You can see how desired pitch (and roll as well, you could see from logs) jumps from stabilizing copter to zero. Sometimes (86.5s - 87s) you can see that desired pitch goes back to stabilize when the motors are still saturated, but I believe it might be somewhere on the boundary of saturation and it unblocks the attitude control.\n\nBut it seems that copter will start to stabilize attitude even when the motors are saturated if you give an rc input, like you can observe on the picture below. At around 270.5 it goes from off-board to poscontrol mode while motors are full up and only 272, when the rc input for position change are given the desired attitude starts to be non-zero.\n10_03_49.px4log\n![pasted image at 2016_10_10 13_47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7020958/19237926/1a04de08-8ef7-11e6-8858-8a78a309ec63.png)\n\nIf it's intentionally made that multirotors don't keep the attitude when the motors are full powered in order to keep altitude, I don't think it's the best idea. When the copter start to suddenly fly away without you commanding it and completely neglecting wind in my opinion more dangerous if it would slowly go down while still trying to fight the wind.

\n\nI'm getting an error while building PX4 for SITL simulation with Gazebo. I installed the pre-requisites as stated in [this page](http://dev.px4.io/simulation-gazebo.html) and ran `make posix_sitl_default gazebo`. I got the following error:\n\n```\n--   Found protobuf, version 3.0.2\nGazebo version: 7.3\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:80 (message):\n  protobuf version: 3.0.2 not compatible, must be >= 2.5.0 and < 3.0.0\n\n\n-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!\n```\n\nSo it appears that the protobuf version I have is too new, therefore I downloaded the newest version below v3.0.0 (as the error log is suggesting) which is v2.6.1 and I installed it. Then I proceeded to re-run the build as follows:\n\n```\nmake posix_sitl_default clean\nmake posix_sitl_default gazebo\n```\n\nI get a new error which is very long, but I'll only display the beginning since it says where it does come from:\n\n```\nIn file included from SensorImu.pb.cc:5:\nIn file included from ./SensorImu.pb.h:27:\n/usr/local/Cellar/gazebo7/7.3.1_4/include/gazebo-7/gazebo/msgs/quaternion.pb.h:12:2: error: This file was generated by a newer version of protoc which is\n#error This file was generated by a newer version of protoc which is\n ^\n/usr/local/Cellar/gazebo7/7.3.1_4/include/gazebo-7/gazebo/msgs/quaternion.pb.h:13:2: error: incompatible with your Protocol Buffer headers.  Please update\n#error incompatible with your Protocol Buffer headers.  Please update\n ^\n/usr/local/Cellar/gazebo7/7.3.1_4/include/gazebo-7/gazebo/msgs/quaternion.pb.h:14:2: error: your headers.\n#error your headers.\n ^\n```\n\nSo now it seems like some headers that are used by protobuf has been generated by a newer version, and thus it is not able to recognize them.
