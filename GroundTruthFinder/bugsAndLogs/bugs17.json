#10116 specifically the introduction of **MPU_DEVICE_TYPE_MPU9250** into the bus options list breaks compatibility for mpu9250/mpu6500 on any supported bus. This parameter essentially enforces device+bus pairing because the discovery process just runs through the list until it finds a device that responds to it on that bus. The 9250 is listed first, and thus it will always \"discover\" as a 9250 **device type**. \n![selection_004](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37091262/49833943-5b915280-fd58-11e8-8185-da0d091d5f64.png)\n_If I put the 6500 first, it works.... however this requires a priori knowledge of the device to be used on a given bus, which goes against plug-and-play architecture_.\n\n**Solution**\nUse `probe()` to read the **WHO_AM_I** register to determine device type. Do this at the discovery stage (`start_bus`) and save it as a member variable. You can than use this in place of **MPU_DEVICE_TYPE_MPU9250** to do all the device specific stuff you need to do.\n\nI've [pushed up a branch to fix](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/pr-fix_mpu9250_bus_options), but I do not have an ICM20948 so I cannot test if this works with that device. This is yet another reason why we should not slam together hardware specific drivers into a single driver (unless we are very careful about how we do it).\n\n@flochir @DanielePettenuzzo @dagar @bkueng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11017","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11017/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11017/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11017/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11017","id":389886154,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODk4ODYxNTQ=","number":11017,"title":"mavlink parameter issues to review","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1450324872,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDUwMzI0ODcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Communication%20(MAVLink)%20%F0%9F%93%A1","name":"Communication (MAVLink) 📡","color":"f66608","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-12-11T18:03:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T15:38:04Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T15:38:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":" -

are getting a lot of false positive \"Preflight Fail: HIGH IMU ACCEL BIAS\" warning messages preventing arming.  This seems to have started in master this past spring and continues in stable 1.8.0.  I believe a lot of other PX4 users are getting these false positive warnings as well.\n\n- (Note: in recent master the text of this warning as changed to \"Preflight Fail: High Accelerometer Bias\")\n\nThis happens to us frequently on known good aircraft that are great fliers and continue to fly great once the fault is cleared. \n\nWe recently noticed the error seems correlated to a vehicle sitting level on the ground for some period of time.  @priseborough made a helpful suggestion to try pitching and rolling the vehicle slowly so that the X and Y accels could spend some time facing down (gravity) and EKF2 could better estimate their bias.  This worked to clear the error!  Here is an example of the error which was then easily cleared by pitching and rolling the vehicle:\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=278fa376-2a02-4027-b465-12507dbc9062\n\n**Possible solution:**\nIt has been suggested that using the bias state uncertainty as a factor in the bias level check could help eliminate false positives.  The bias level check in Commander could use the already existing additional information from EKF2 for this.\n\n\n**Further support:**\n\nAnecdotally I know of this exact ACCEL BIAS warning happening to handfuls of other PX4 users, many of whom do not post to Github or Discuss.\n\nThere are a large number of github issues and PX4Discuss posts about getting this error.  Probably there are many complicating factors involved with each report, but the fact that there are so many makes me believe there is a systemic issue with the check, or the checks and warnings need to be more

I see 2 problems:\r\n- The FlightTaskAuto contains states and resets certain attributes when switching (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/Auto/FlightTaskAuto.cpp#L468). In case of the reposition, the switches were random due to numerical inaccuracies. If possible we should avoid these states.\r\n- FlightTaskAutoLine uses _target and _prev_wp to determine the velocity direction (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/AutoLine/FlightTaskAutoLine.cpp#L79). However this might not reflect where the vehicle currently is (I guess the states are meant to prevent this, but it doesn't seem to work).\r\n\r\nThe combination of all these led to the unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes

Fast desktop computer with Windows 10\n2. Installed [Cygwin Toolchain](https://dev.px4.io/en/setup/dev_env_windows_cygwin.html)\n3. start `make posix jmavsim` on latest master\n4. Sometimes it works fine even for longer periods, sometimes the errors and twitches occur\n\n**Expected behavior**\nSimulation should work just fine on a modern computer that isn't overloaded. It also worked fine before, I'm not sure but I think on 1.8 I didn't have any obvious problem not even on a slower laptop.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nI can provide a simulation log if that helps.\n\nAdd screenshots to help explain your problem.\n\n\n**Additional context**\nIf I look closely at the description of this issue it looks very similar: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/10098\n\nMachine is fast enough and not overloaded and it doesn't always happen but regularly/consistently.\n\nI'd suspect threading priority problems with Windows if none of this happens on any other platform but there might be a general problem that just shows off on Windows. While I ported SITL to Cygwin I had to adjust some priority numbers. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/8407/files#diff-b3ac3b41912e12a40f44757b561a0e4dR216 could be related.\n\nAnother general question is why should the simulation not work fine just slower if the physics simulation cannot run in real time. I think this was discussed before.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10686","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10686/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10686/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10686/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10686","id":370112371,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzAxMTIzNzE=","number":10686,"title":"Consistantly failing preflight checks","user":{"login":"baumanta","id":25756842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzU2ODQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25756842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta","html_url":"https://github.com/baumanta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2018-10-15T11:09:28Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T20:40:07Z","closed_at":"2020-09-07T20:40:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\nIn SITL ROS with gazebo: After launching the simulation, the drone can not be armed.

Yes, I will also do some digging into fixing this bug that I am filing. ;) )\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSubmit a PR.  Wait for CI tools to complete.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nOne would guess that only files impacted by the PR would be those able to cause issues.

It turns out that the way to satisfy QGC (and PX4) is to set the orientation of GPS2 (an external 3DR GPS module) to a yaw of 180. It seems as though PX4 rotates the incoming magnetometer data and therefore doesn't recognize that both modules are pointing in the same direction even though they are. \n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Disable the onboard mag. (Not sure that this matters, but this is how I have it for other reasons.)\n2. Configure two external GPS modules pointing forward on the airframe.\n3. Connect to the Pixhawk in QGroundControl.\n4. See MAG SENSOR INCONSISTENT error preventing arming.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nRotating the orientation of the GPS module in software should not have to happen since it's obviously a misleading error. PX4 should recognize that both mags are oriented in the same direction. \n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nn/a\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\nPX4 \"Standard Plane\" v1.8 firmware.\n\n**Additional context**\nPX4 did not complain about this before v1.8.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10608","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10608/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10608/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10608/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/10608","id":365240074,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjE5MjE0MDgw","number":10608,"title":"Cygwin: Fix target upload by catching non-standard baud exception","user":{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-09-30T16:44:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T08:01:47Z","closed_at":"2018-10-02T08:01:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/10608","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/10608","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/10608.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/10608.patch","merged_at":"2018-10-02T08:01:43Z"},"body":"fixes #10429\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI tried multiple uploads with different branches to a pixhawk 4 board using my home PC.

But dividing a matrix by a constant is equivalent to multiplying its inverse by the same constant, so, the way the existing code handles it is fine.\n* The rotation matrix can be extracted from a accel_T by performing a row normalization. Although it is no longer needed for accelerometer rotation (the accel_T already performs this) it is handy for any gyroscope that shares a package with an accelerometer.\n\nRegards,\n\nBob\n\n```\n*

It took me a couple of days but I have narrowed it down to `src/drivers/px4fmu/fmu.cpp` where there is both a publish and a subscribe to the uORB topic `actuators_armed`. It is perhaps intended to be generic to the situation where there is no safety button.\n\nWhat happens is that the `orb_check()` call on `_sub_safety` never returns an update, for whatever reason (i.e. `updated = false`). This bug was particularly difficult to find, because mostly everything seemed normal -- and there was no error message, since the logic that is supposed to notify you that you're trying to arm with the safety on is actually not in this same place. (And the safety was of course not on.)\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Run PX4 v1.8.0 as released with Pixracer board, px4fmu v4.\n2. Try to start motors\n4. Armed and running light comes on (steady red) and PWM signal is at idle.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nMotors to spin.\n\nI will forego the rest of the details as I believe this is more than enough information to fix this problem. I'm however not sure why this hasn't happened to you all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10443","id":358690130,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTg2OTAxMzA=","number":10443,"title":"jMAVSim

This is the third time I've seen this in two weeks. I've seen it ~10 times since the introduction of FlightTasks. We are flying ~7 hours a week, so this is a very rare edge case bug. Logging either dies completely or drops out when this happens. I finally have a partial log (2 minute long dropout) of a flight where this happened. \n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Takeoff using mode `takeoff`\n2. Fly around in position mode\n3. Issue `land` or `rtl`\n4. This behavior will persist through a land/disarm/arm/takeoff\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=7955d3de-31c9-4434-b30d-cb31fadefb32\n\n**Additional context**\nI am pretty sure `takeoff` is causing the bug. I am fairly certain `navigator` gets stuck in a loop somewhere, this would explain the logger dropouts due to thread starvation (navigator priority is higher than logger). I am guessing all `auto` modes will cause this, we only use `land` and `rtl`, but both of those modes do the same thing, fly right towards home.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10406","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10406/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10406/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10406/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10406","id":356597554,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTY1OTc1NTQ=","number":10406,"title":"[Intel

problem solved by the proposed pull request**\nAfter a lot of debugging I found out that the problem is the cygwin is that named pipes also called fifos which are used for the posix shell server client IPC (inter process communication) are not fully POSIX compliant. Namely opening the same pipe \"file\" multiple times from the same process is not supported. But exactly this is done in the implementation to server multiple clients corresponding to multiple `px4-...` bash commands e.g. one for every entry in the startup script.\n\nThere are multiple discussions in the web (I don't find all of them anymore) and they show that it is a persistent problem which is not likely solved anytime soon:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/14450547/multiple-reader-writer-on-fifo-named-pipe\nhttp://cygwin.1069669.n5.nabble.com/Bug-Named-Pipes-FIFO-Bash-td10925.html\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nIt's the fastest, easiest working solution I could come up with to unblock people who cannot use the simulation anymore. The commit message explains it:\n\nposix-shell server: switch pipe flag to read/write\nto make it non-blocking and ommit opening the same\nnamed pipe multiple times inside the same process\nwhich seems to be not supported in cygwin.\n\n**Test data / coverage**\nI tested several times on my work and home pc, it starts again and the startup script runs through. I can fly in simulation and it seems all repaired. But sometimes I run into other problems like sensor errors followed by a drone crash maybe unrelated performance issues with the implementation (i7-8700K cannot be the issue). I appreciate any people testing this branch and giving feedback if they experience further problems to decide if it's a viable workaround.\n\nI found a minor issue: Ctrl+C only works followed by pressing enter, no idea why yet\n\n**Describe possible alternatives**\nUse a different IPC under cygwin or in general. E.g. only some WinAPI calls on Windows or POSIX socket implementation in general. All comments are welcome.\n\n**Additional context**\nfixes #10098\nFYI @amitmc19","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10370","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10370/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10370/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10370/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10370","id":355546812,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTU1NDY4MTI=","number":10370,"title":"SITL with Gazebo and ROS does not receive data","user":{"login":"christiansprecher","id":23553154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUzMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23553154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher","html_url":"https://github.com/christiansprecher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiansprecher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1200459484,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAwNDU5NDg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-08-30T11:40:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T16:12:35Z","closed_at":"2019-02-18T00:23:12Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"When launching SITL in Gazebo with a ROS wrapper, it does not receive data over the UDP port.\nI followed the last part of the [tutorial](https://dev.px4.io/en/simulation/ros_interface.html) (section What's Happening Behind the Scenes).\n\nWhen running `no_sim=true make posix_sitl_default gazebo` and `roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch world_name:=$(pwd)/Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds/iris.world`, the first terminal stops at \n\n`INFO  [simulator] Waiting for initial data on UDP port 14560.
