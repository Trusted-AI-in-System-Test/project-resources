Nuttx is correct and includes the command name in `argv[0]`. But the Posix-Implementation only adds the arguments to `argv`, which is not, what's commonly used.\nIt's the same on macOS and Linux.\n\n**Describe the bug**\nI took the `hello` example application as a staring point for my application. Then I noticed, that the `argc` variable is not the same on nuttx and posix inside a newly spawned task (with `px4_task_spawn_cmd`).\n\nThe task is spawned like this:\n```c\npx4_task_spawn_cmd(\"hello\",\n                   SCHED_DEFAULT, SCHED_PRIORITY_MAX - 5, 2000,\n                   PX4_MAIN,\n                   (argv) ? (char *const *)&argv[2] : (char *const *)nullptr);\n```\n\nWhen running `hello start`, nuttx will set `argc` and `argv` to these values inside the task:\n- argc = 1\n- argv[0] = hello\n\nOn posix on the other hand:\n- argc = 0\n- argv[0] is empty\n\nWhen running `hello start -h`, nuttx will set `argc` and `argv` to these values inside the task:\n- argc = 2\n- argv[0] = hello\n- argv[1] = -h\n\nOn posix on the other hand:\n- argc = 1\n- argv[0] = -h\n- argv[1] is empty\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Take the hello example app\n2. Add some code to output the `argc` and `argv` variables\n3. Run the application with different amounts of arguments in Nuttx and Posix\n4. See error\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe argument order and count would be the same on Nuttx and Posix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12092","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12092/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12092/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12092/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12092","id":449089734,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDkwODk3MzQ=","number":12092,"title":"Bug: Clearing mission not possible","user":{"login":"AuterionWrikeBot","id":39693579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjkzNTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39693579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot","html_url":"https://github.com/AuterionWrikeBot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AuterionWrikeBot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"julianoes","id":1419688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes","html_url":"https://github.com/julianoes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"julianoes","id":1419688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes","html_url":"https://github.com/julianoes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianoes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2019-05-28T06:42:57Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T08:26:29Z","closed_at":"2019-10-01T08:26:22Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Clearing mission was not possible.\nWe had the same issue last week.

flying in Altitude mode and all height sources failed (GPS and Baro), PX4 does not switch to stabilized mode but stays in altitude mode, which is obviously not possible to achieve any more. (Only tested in jmavsim STIL)\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Start jmavsim SITL simulation with QGroundControl (with on screen RC inputs enabled or using a RC via USB/ Serial)\n1. type `commander takeoff` in the PX4 shell\n1. the vehicle takes off and holds position\n1. change to position mode in QGC\n1. type `gpssim stop` in the PX4 shell\n1. PX4 switches from position mode to altitude\n1. stop/ disable the barometer (`barosim stop` in the PX4 shell)\n1. PX4 stays in altitude mode\n1. (I switched to manual to be able to land the vehicle and then disarmed/ emergency stopped in QGC)\n\nThe issue is the same, if the barometer fails first (then PX4 will do a failover to GPS height) and GPS is turned off second.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nPX4 should switch from altitude to stabilized or at least print a warning in QGC.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=0d53ff6b-2cb8-4955-8940-05f1bb611fff\n(I still had a patch running, that disables the magnetometer, so there is no mag data. But this does not affect the issue.)\n\n**Additional context**\nHere is my patch which adds a `stop` command to the `barosim`:\n\n```patch\ndiff --git a/src/modules/simulator/barosim/baro.cpp

the bug**\nThis is a vtol plane I flew for about 15+ flights. \n\n1. The FC is a hex cube. \n1. Firmware version is derived from 1.8.1 stable, RTK gps driver is modified. \n1. Before this crash flight, I encontered\nThis time when plane is in mission, reached the 5th waypoint, the plane didn't continue mission, however, it continued to fly towards the 5th point, the flight path is like a \"8\", then all the command from QGC became useless, still I can see all the plane status (attitude/vel/pos...). At the end the plane ran out of battery and crashed. (no RC, or I would have saved the plane)\n\n**To Reproduce**\nTwo ways to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Prepare the plane with RC, upload the mission, then plug out the sd card before manually take-off. Fly the plane, then switch to mission mode, the plane would fly to the only known point, the flght path is an \"8\".\n1. In HIL with rotory wing (can't use fw hil), make the rw excecuting mission, then plug out the sd card, the rw would stop at the moment it reaches the current waypoint and stop there. Made several tests, seems that MAVLINK_MISSION and NAVIGATOR modules stopped. COMMANDER module works normally. Switching mode in QGC is useless, mavlink console is dead. RTL is also useless. Only RC can truely switch the mode to manual/altitude/position. \nI checked code, I doubt it's a datamanager problem, maybe one semaphore is blocked... But I don't know how to dig this deeper.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nHere is the 4 minutes log for this crash, sorry I don't have a tlog as I use Ipad.\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=34ff913a-5414-4046-87db-181a0ea7b507\n\n**Additional context**\nThe same thing I suffered one year ago is shown below, after that crash, I changed my SD card to a Kingston card. Then this problem seems solved. However it crashed again as the SD card is obviously not good enough. I will use industriel sd card in the future, but I hope we can do something in code side, we can't guarantee the sd card quality every time...\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/9271#issuecomment-383260595\n\nPlease help me out of this, I would like to offer any message you need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12071/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12063","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12063/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12063/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12063/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12063","id":448029952,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjgxOTA2MzM2","number":12063,"title":"fix

the geofence failsafe has a higher priority than the low battery check. It means that in case of a low battery failsafe action (e.g.: land) while in the no-flight zone (NFZ), the geofence action will override the action and can hold the drone in air until death. Also, when the geofence failsafe is set to \"Loiter\", the user cannot bring the drone back into the fence because as soon as he switches into a manual mode, the failsafe is triggered again and the drone stops.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the following scenario is currently possible: \r\n- The user flies the drone that goes out of the geofence, the geofence failsafe is triggered and switches to loiter (hold). \r\n- The user wants to bring the drone back inside the flight zone in manual position control mode; he switches to that mode, the geofence failsafe triggers again and stops the drone.\r\n- After a few tries, the batteries are low and the battery failsafe triggers and commands the drone to land.\r\n- The geofence failsafe triggers again and stops the drone.\r\n- The batteries are now empty, the drone crashes.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the following things:\r\n- Geofence failsafe cannot trigger while in low battery emergency action\r\n- Geofence failsafe only triggers on transition `flight zone -> no-flight zone`. This means that the user can switch to a manual mode and fly back into the fly zone. I also means that the user can fly further, but this is not a concern for now.\r\n\r\nNote that the purpose of this PR is to bring the geofence action into a safe state. Further improvements will arrive later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12035","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12035/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12035/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12035/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12035","id":445459172,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDU0NTkxNzI=","number":12035,"title":"FW review RTL loiter behaviour","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":78699916,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODY5OTkxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Fixed%20Wing%20%F0%9F%9B%A9%EF%B8%8F","name":"Fixed Wing 🛩️","color":"009800","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2019-05-17T14:04:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T14:12:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"From https://discuss.px4.io/t/plane-flyaway-recovery-rtl-loiter-then-flew-away/10991.\n\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=a204d10b-a40d-4c05-9bb6-6f2c23bf574c\n\n> I found that putting a FIXED WING LANDING PATTERN in the mission FROM the preset “pattern” icon/button, then setting the RTL mode to head for the landing 1st (NOT head directly to home), causes the plane to go to that loiter-to-land pattern and subsequently line up to the runway and land correctly.

problem solved by the proposed pull request**\r\nDuring RTL, some users (thanks @bkueng ) reported that the behavior of the drone during the RTL final descent is weird: it accelerates and decelerates several times instead of simply performing a \"land\".\r\nI discovered that this was caused by the intermediate waypoint placed by RTL between \"descend\" and \"land.\r\nThis PR simply adds a shortcut in the state machine to directly go to land mode and skip that waypoint if RTL is configured as \"Return home, then land immediately\".\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nSITL tests:\r\nWithout this

As a result the transition in stabilized mode for tailsitters was not working anymore.\r\n@bkueng FYI\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR switches to use the fixed wing attitude controller for transitions for standard VTOL and tiltrotors. The MC attitude controller has too small attitude time constants an resulted in oscillations during transitions. For tailsitters we still need to rely on the mc attitude controller during the transition as the fixed wing attitude controller is not designed to operate at high pitch angles (around 90 degrees

Looking at some logs it is not achieving the target pitch angle (15 deg), but the control system isn't trying very hard to get there.\r\n\r\nMight there be an integrator issue or is something else going on with airspeed and gain scaling?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12117027/56701401-91f6bb00-66c4-11e9-835e-3dbd02233b24.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample logs here:\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=a8b193bc-f3d7-4cab-ae3e-ba0302c1834b\r\nand\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=09b99ed1-aef6-4eff-8d44-d166307f7132","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11906","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11906/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11906/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11906/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11906","id":436856982,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjczMjU5Nzc1","number":11906,"title":"adis16497: fix TEMP_OUT conversion according to the datasheet","user":{"login":"ThijsRay","id":2600324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDAzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2600324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay","html_url":"https://github.com/ThijsRay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThijsRay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/29/labels","id":3761959,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzc2MTk1OQ==","number":29,"title":"Release v1.9.0","description":"PX4 Stable Release v1.9.0","creator":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":137,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-23T14:25:59Z","updated_at":"2021-01-10T17:51:52Z","due_on":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-05-25T14:10:35Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-04-24T18:59:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T13:22:07Z","closed_at":"2019-04-26T13:22:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/11906","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11906","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11906.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11906.patch","merged_at":"2019-04-26T13:22:07Z"},"body":"**Test data / coverage**\r\nNot available.\r\n\r\n**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**\r\nTemperature read outs from the adis16497 are incorrect, because the conversion process is incorrect.

the bug**\r\nThe SD card does not mount on a Pixhawk 4.

Upload v1.8.2 stock firmware on pixhawk 4\r\n2. power cycle autopilot with the stock 4GB SD card\r\n3. Connect Qground control \r\n4. See if SD card is mounted using the _mount_ command on nsh.

Trying to mount the SD card using _mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/fs_ crashes pixhawk \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe SD card should be mounted. _mount_ command on NSH should return the _/fs/microsd_ as a mounted directory.\r\nAlternatively, if this is a hardware problem with the pixhawk 4, there needs to be a way to identify and isolate this. Verified that the SD card works with a different pixhawk 4. \r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nNo log files are available since SD card can\r\n\r\nAdd screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\nNot mounted on a drone yet\r\n\r\n**Alternative approaches tried to debug the issue:**\r\n\r\n1.

https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/11785.\n\n> Negative pitch setpoint - If you have a negative pitch setpoint to use during level flight, you are essentially wanting the plane to nose down (or up) to not change altitude while in the air. The issue is that during takeoff if you look at pitch setpoint you will see that it is actually the specified pitch minus the setpoint (we have takeoff pitch set to 12º but are getting 7º of pitch up on takeoff because we have a negative set point of 5 degrees (FW_PSP_OFF). What we are seeing is a real “airframe” pitch of 7 degrees instead of 12 (because of the offset and it thinks it is 12º) and the elevator up is sort of giving 12º up but not really since when level on the ground the elevator is technically giving 5º pitch down.\n> Quick solution is probably to simply let runway takeoff pitch setpoint (RWTO_PSP) able to be a positive number. It is currently not allowed to be.\n\nThe pitch and pitch limits are shifted by the pitch setpoint offset before sent into TECS. This was being done inconsistently only for position and loiter setpoint types.\n\nRelated

the bug**\r\nWe discovered that the heater in the cube is not completely off in 1.8.2 firmware, and that the green ring LEDs also increase the temp in the cube. Disabling the LEDs and completely shutting off the heater reduced sensor temps by 15-25 deg C. This is the new issue requested by @dagar to make sure this is looked at. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/5963\r\n\r\nWe have discovered that the heater is not 100% off as of 1.8.2 firmware. PX4 sets the io pin to be OPEN_DRAIN, and then sets it high, which leaves the heater control pin floating. Because of interactions with the resistor network and the transistor that powers the heaters, the heat is on a small amount, that gets worse as temperature increases.\r\n\r\nChanging the drive pin for the heater to PUSH_PULL and setting to high, we get the heater to turn completely off. Both that it was partially on and that this fix turned it all the way off were experimentally measured on 2.1 hardware.\r\n\r\nWe also disabled the green \"RING\" LEDs as they were putting 0.3W into the cube, and in our design are not visible anyway.\r\n\r\nWith lights off and the heater completely off, we've seen 20-25C drop in sensor temperatures inside the cube. We had to make this change because we were pushing sensors out of spec at only 45-50C ambient. We can now calibrate to almost 60C ambient without pushing sensors past absolute operating max, and still have a little headroom. The MPU9250s get hotter than anything else, presumably because they are self-heating somewhat, but they also have a 105C absolute max operating that we do not exceed while doing temp calibration.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run cube with temp calibration bits enabled with stock 1.8.2 until all temps stabilize. Check temps on each sensor\r\n2. Modify firmware to disable Green LED_RING, ensure LED_BLUE() never turns on, and set px4io GPIO_LED1 to push_pull to force heater off\r\n4. Run same temp run with cube as in number 1, note difference in temps on the sensors.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWith this change, we saw temps drop by up to 25C.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- This was tested with a pixhawk 2.1 cube\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe made some fairly aggressive changes while testing this and didn't try and finesse it, but these were the changes we made:\r\n\r\n- src/drivers/boards/px4io-v2/board_config.h : GPIO_LED1 (which is heater pin PB14) was changed from GPIO_CNF_OUTOD to GPIO_CNF_OUTPP to make it push pull, so setting high will drive it high and fully disable heater.\r\n- src/modules/px4iofirmware/px4io.c: Disabled the heartbeat_blink call because LED_BLUE is GPIO_LED1, prevents anything from toggling that pin\r\n- src/modules/px4iofirmware/px4io.c: Disabled the ring_blink() function to keep the green ring leds off always.\r\n- src/modules/px4iofirmware/px4io.c: in the section that talks about police lights, we disabled the calls to LED_BLUE because even if we have a memory fault, we really don't want it blinking the heater pin.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11832/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11830","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11830/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11830/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11830/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11830","id":431565913,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzE1NjU5MTM=","number":11830,"title":"Here

After servel seconds the red led will blink fast.\n\nIf I do not connect qgc immediately after power on ,or connect the qgc after servel seconds(the time of gps connect) the led run well.\n\n* I saw the code,the problem may be:\n\npoll_telemetry_status() in commander.cpp\n\n```\n/* perform system checks when new telemetry link connected */\nif (/* we first connect a link or re-connect a link after loosing it or haven't yet reported anything */\n(_telemetry[i].last_heartbeat == 0 || (hrt_elapsed_time(&_telemetry[i].last_heartbeat) > 3_s)\n|| !_telemetry[i].preflight_checks_reported) &&\n/* and this link has a communication partner */\n(telemetry.heartbeat_time > 0) &&\n/* and it is still connected */\n(hrt_elapsed_time(&telemetry.heartbeat_time) < 2_s) &&\n/* and the system is not already armed (and potentially flying) */\n!armed.armed) {\n\n/* flag the checks as reported for this link when we actually report them */\n_telemetry[i].preflight_checks_reported = status_flags.condition_system_hotplug_timeout;\n\npreflight_check(true);\n\n// Provide feedback on mission state\nconst mission_result_s &mission_result = _mission_result_sub.get();\n\nif ((mission_result.timestamp > commander_boot_timestamp) && status_flags.condition_system_hotplug_timeout &&\n(mission_result.instance_count > 0) && !mission_result.valid) {\n\nmavlink_log_critical(&mavlink_log_pub, \"Planned mission fails check.

This causes the position controller to go into failsafe and forces the Z velocity setpoint to the land speed:\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/3d271245a1052ea612b88a4ddf871286356cba94/src/modules/mc_pos_control/mc_pos_control_main.cpp#L1112-L1140\n\nThe problem is that when the local position is regained, the setpoint is again generated by the FlightTask and doesn't know the previous setpoint -> velocity setpoint discontinuity.\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior in SITL:\n1. Takeoff\n2. Before the drone reaches the desired altitude, stop the GPS (`gpssim stop`)\n3.

Go to PX4-firmware and clean the build.\n```\ncd <px4-src-dir>\nmake clean\n```\n3. add `PX4_INFO`\n* [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/drivers/gps/gps.cpp#L469):  `PX4_INFO(\"written: %d\", written);`\n* [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/drivers/gps/gps.cpp#L342):\n`PX4_INFO(\"read: %d\", num_read);`\n4. Build your target and upload. Include the `external_module`-repo\n```\nmake <target>  EXTERNAL_MODULES_LOCATION=<path to external_module> upload\n```\n5. Open `System console` and turn on the drone:\nYou should see the gps-read print that we added above.\n\n6. Open mavlink-shell\n```\n./Tools/mavlink_shell.sh\n```\n7. start `gps_injeciton_app` from the `mavlink-shell`:\n```\nnsh> gps_injection_app start\n```\nThe `gps_injection_app` sends fake `gps_inject_data`-msg for simulating a data burst. In the `System console`, you will see that the gps-driver will be occupied with writing without having any read in between. On a real setup, this results in GPS-device loss. \n\n**Expected behavior**\nReading from the gps-device should continue despite writing to the device. \n\n**Additional context**\nA workaround that fixed the issue (temporary solution):\nRead data from the rover for every predefined amount of data written to the rover.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11716/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11716/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11715","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11715/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11715/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11715/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11715","id":424647343,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjYzOTI4MDIw","number":11715,"title":"cmake

Furthermore, the problem does not occur with 1.8.2 on the same hardware with the same parameters.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7610489/54767425-654f0f80-4bfd-11e9-952a-1b1678205eca.png)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11685","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11685/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11685/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11685/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11685","id":423178380,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MjMxNzgzODA=","number":11685,"title":"Propellers small rotation during rebooting from QGC on copter","user":{"login":"fpvaspassion","id":7286081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODYwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7286081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion","html_url":"https://github.com/fpvaspassion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpvaspassion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-03-20T10:35:26Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T15:24:32Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T14:56:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\nHello,  when changing some parameters like EKF2_AID_MASK we need to reboot controller from QGC.

In the example below, a set of Flight Modes were assigned to CH6 on a 3-way switch, and \"Stabilize\" mode was assigned to CH9 on a 2-way switch. When the 2-way switch is activated, the Flight mode on the icon bar still reflects what's on the 3-way and no audio call out for \"Stabilize\" is made.

If not, please advise when resolved and hopefully a downloadable link.\n\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11657/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11657/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11647","id":421138904,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjYxMjU4MDcw","number":11647,"title":"Trajectory generator fixes","user":{"login":"bresch","id":14822839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14822839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch","html_url":"https://github.com/bresch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bresch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":78699954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODY5OTk1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Multirotor%20%F0%9F%9B%B8","name":"Multirotor 🛸","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-03-14T17:01:00Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T15:26:03Z","closed_at":"2019-03-18T07:33:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/11647","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11647","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11647.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11647.patch","merged_at":"2019-03-18T07:33:12Z"},"body":"### Context:\nThe trajectory generator (called VelocitySmoothing here) is basically an optimizer that tries to find an optimal jerk signal of fixed amplitude to control each output of a chain of two integrators (i.e.: control acceleration and velocity) while minimizing the time to reach the desired state and satisfying maximum acceleration.\n\n### Problem:\nWhen the defined jerk is large and the velocity/acceleration targets are small, the problem cannot be solved given the fixed time interval (this is a discrete-time problem). The drone sometimes keeps drifting while the stick is centered because the velocity is non-zero.\n\n### Proposed solution:\nWhen the velocity and acceleration are small, decrease the jerk (set it to 1) such that the optimizer can find a new solution and move closer to zero. Once the outputs are small enough, force them to 0.\n\n### Other changes:\n- Some division by 0 and sqrt of negative number protections.\n- A simple script that uses the VelocitySmoothing library. This is used to debug the code, verify the outputs and compare them to the original python script. The next step is to run a true unit test to compare the outputs automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11646","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11646/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11646/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11646/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11646","id":421052469,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MjEwNTI0Njk=","number":11646,"title":"Achievable speed against heavy wind depends on auto vs manual","user":{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":78699954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODY5OTk1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Multirotor%20%F0%9F%9B%B8","name":"Multirotor 🛸","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2019-03-14T14:30:47Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T16:00:36Z","closed_at":"2020-02-19T16:00:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\nI cannot be 100% sure that this also happens on master but I'm assuming this now and verify.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1.

all,\nWe observed some issues with the auxiliary PWM outputs on the PX4fmu_v5. \nWe're using the holybro px4, and the issue shows similar behaviour on all recent-ish supported firmware version (1.8.2, 1.8.0 1.7.4, 1.71).\n\n* We first observed the problem as discussed here:https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/10677 The lower props of a 12 rotor config do not turn on (upper 6 are on the MAIN/IO, lower 6 on the AUX/FMU)\n* Startup scripts etc look correct. So when I manually load the mixer file for the upper rotors (`mixer load /dev/pwm_output0 /etc/mixers/forgotfilename.main.mix`), this works. If I try to load the mixer file for the bottom rotors (`mixer load /dev/pwm_output1 /etc/mixers/forgot_bottom.aux.mix`) it throws failed to load mixer. It does that for any arbitrary mixer file, as soon as I want to load it to /dev/pwm_output1\n* fmu driver is started and set to mode_pwm8. Stopping/starting/setting as thread doesn't change behavior.\n* \"fmu test\" reboots the pixhawk. \"fmu fake 100 100 100 100 100 \" doesn't do anything\n* \"pwm -d /dev/pwm_device0\" works nicely (IO pwm's). \n* \"pwm -d /dev/pwm_device1\" reboots the system. \n\nSo long story short, the PWM FMU driver of the px4fmu_v5 seems to have an issue - we can't get it to work. \n\nAny idea what we're doing wrong or if there's something wrong with the firmware/driver/nuttx board definition?

I tried this on PixRacer Hardware on a fixed wing plane with X-UAV Mini Talon airframe.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nI setup the camera trigger via QGroundControl 3.5.0. The firmware is a custom version with minor changes (airframe plus a modified MAVLINK_MODE_MINIMAL message list) based on the 1.8.2 release (see https://github.com/fredowski/Firmware/commits/searchwing18 ). I guess that the modifications are not related to this problem but I mention the anyway. The camera trigger parameter setup is:\n\nTRIG_MODE: 2 (This does not matter as long as the camera trigger is not disabled)\nTRIG_INTERFACE: 3 (MAVLINK Interface - no PIN modification expected)\nTRIG_PINS: 56 (default)\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expect the camera trigger to appear as mavlink only message on telemetry 2 port without modifying the PWM outputs on the PixRacer. So it should still be possible to use the PWM5 output for the motor.\n\n**Observed behavior**\nThe observed behavior is that once the camera trigger setup is activated, the motor starts as the motor of the plane is connected to PWM MAIN 5 (Servo Pin 5 on the PixRacer). Stupid as I am I had the propeller still attached... \n\n**Questions**\nThe setup process is a two step process where first the camera trigger is activated and only then the further parameters can be modified. I tried to modify the parameters via the QGC parameter list directly but without the TRIG_MODE parameter, the other parameters seem not to exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/11630","id":420214191,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjYwNTQ0MDI3","number":11630,"title":"Use
