Coming back to it today and I found out that the motors no longer respond. I am able to arm the drone using the transmitter and through QGroundControl but the motors do not idle spin nor does it respond when increasing the throttle. Even the usual twitching does not occur when I connect the battery. I have checked that the Pixhawk, PDB, and RC receiver are turned on as usual.\n\nI used APM Planner to flash arducopter firmware and did all the calibrations and the motors are working perfectly. However, when I flashed back the PX4 firmware through QGroundControl the problem still persists.

cygwin treatment (https://github.com/PX4-NuttX/nuttx/blob/b18053574bf41712cef93e31bf178518f451a350/configs/stm32f4discovery/scripts/Make.defs#L42-L56)\r\n\r\nAdditionally the ${PX4_SOURCE_DIR}/src/include which was added through cmake needs path conversion\r\n\r\nThe two root causes for the special handling are:\r\n- ARM GCC for Windows doesn't support cygwin paths passed as an argument\r\n  so they need to be either relative or converted via cypath tool\r\n- Symbolic links are totally different under Windows and because NuttX uses them extensively\r\n  it has special handling scripts that need to be fed with the correct defines\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@dagar Now it's partly makefile `${shell ...}` path conversion like NuttX did it before and partly  cmake `CYGPATH(...)` conversion because you added  `${PX4_SOURCE_DIR}/src/include` via cmake. What do you think?\r\n\r\nHow was `${PX4_SOURCE_DIR}/src/include` included before? It always found `visibility.h` so it was included but not in the `CFLAGS`...\r\n\r\nI tested `make px4fmu-v4_default` and `make px4fmu-v2_default` and they run through fine with these changes.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** For reference the pull requests that made this necessary/possible: #7873 #8573","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8737/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8732","id":289817311,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODk4MTczMTE=","number":8732,"title":"\"make px4fmu-v2_default upload\" not working for pixhawk 1","user":{"login":"promistrio","id":6287944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODc5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6287944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio","html_url":"https://github.com/promistrio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/promistrio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-01-18T23:53:18Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T05:20:55Z","closed_at":"2018-01-19T05:20:55Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Now install Ubuntu 16, clone repository, and run make px4fmu-v2_default upload, I getting next error. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6287944/35127616-02817750-fcc4-11e7-8510-a355af74ef80.png)\r\n\r\nWhy?

I recently checked out the latest stable so we could use RTPS instead of MAVLink but now the simulation does not work.\n\nTo get the simulation working, I clone a fresh copy of the stable branch. Afterwards, I run _make posix_sitl_default _gazebo_plane__ to build the firmware. This works and I can connect to the SITL using dronekit.\n\nI then edit the _multi_uav_mavros_sitl.launch_ file to use planes which reads as follows:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19937941/35054144-df46e8f6-fb79-11e7-8523-743e3feca8fd.png)\n\n**NOTE:** The XML for the second UAV is not shown but it is identical to the first UAV except for MAVLink ports, target system numbers, and rcS files. Beforehand, I clone the plane command file into two command files: plane_1 and plane_2. These command files are identical except for MAVLink streams, MAV SYS IDs, and  SITL_UDP_PORT param sets. I do the same for the plane sdf files.\n\nAfter editing the multi-vehicle launch file, I edit the _single_vehcile_spawn.launch_ to read as so:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19937941/35054182-f87fa754-fb79-11e7-9902-d1406c621a7a.png)\n\nI comment out the xacro.py line because I am using sdf files for planes that I generated some time ago.\n\nNext, I run _roslaunch px4 multi_uav_mavros_sitl.launch_ as shown in the next few screenshots below:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19937941/35054518-bdb835d6-fb7a-11e7-9d41-93e22cd391ea.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19937941/35054682-2e6d1a62-fb7b-11e7-970e-0a9a2278f848.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19937941/35054761-65d55898-fb7b-11e7-8da0-01532c771962.png)\n\n**NOTE:** I close the Gazebo GUI and the process finishes cleanly. I also get messages saying the uav-1_plane-1_spawn and uav-2_plane-2_spawn scripts finished successfully, however, I never get command line access to the multi-vehicle simulation as before. Also, the SITL_UDP_PORT numbers seem correct (14560/14562) even though the ROS_MASTER_URI is a different port number.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19937941/35054901-c4e96d88-fb7b-11e7-84cb-26ee9bd400b4.png)\n\nI try to connect via Dronekit in Python but I get a wait_ready timeout which signals that Dronekit did not get parameters in time. I did some debugging and found the simulation to be getting stuck at this line.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19937941/35055035-283e20d6-fb7c-11e7-8b7c-a055d21c9f72.png)\n\nSpecifically, it is line 756 which polls the UDP port for simulation data. This poll never gets anything positive and thus waits forever. Please help. My team relies on the stable firmware to test our planes. I updated the repo because we want to use RTPS but now our old environment doesn't seem to be working. Please help. I've attached the sdf, rcS, and launch files so anyone can duplicate our environment.\n\n[multi-plane-SITL-files.zip](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1639868/multi-plane-SITL-files.zip)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8712/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8707","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8707/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8707/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8707/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8707","id":289018082,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODkwMTgwODI=","number":8707,"title":"Parameter meta data: LPE_FUSION max value set above the value of an int32","user":{"login":"DonLakeFlyer","id":5876851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY4NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer","html_url":"https://github.com/DonLakeFlyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonLakeFlyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"TSC21","id":5048656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDg2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5048656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21","html_url":"https://github.com/TSC21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"TSC21","id":5048656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDg2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5048656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21","html_url":"https://github.com/TSC21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-01-16T18:54:12Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T22:52:46Z","closed_at":"2018-01-17T22:52:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"This causes QGC to spit out a warning about bad meta data.

For instance it would return an enum with `SENSOR_FAIL, SENSORS_NOT_READY, SENSORS_OK`. However I don't think this is necessary. If sensors are not ready, the preflight check should fail and the failure should be handled by the caller. \n2. Modify commander so that  `status_flags.condition_system_sensors_initialized` is also updated in the commander's loop. Maybe this is against design rules, I don't know...\n\n@dagar fyi","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8689","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8689/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8689/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8689/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8689","id":288650570,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTYyOTkzNjg3","number":8689,"title":"astyle allow version 3.1","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-01-15T16:26:19Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T04:48:45Z","closed_at":"2018-05-15T14:39:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/8689","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8689","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8689.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8689.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"Circleci builds (OSX) are failing because astyle v3.1 is now being installed.

I tried to figure MPC Settings in order to sort this out. I have still some strong Oscillation even when slowly moving the Stick back to center. \r\n\r\nTried in about 12m Alt to check some Roll Movements. Just after centering Roll Stick from a Left Bank, the Copter started to get uncontrollable and spiraled down about halfway when it started to fight the motion and managed to just stabilize about 1-2m off the Ground. \r\n\r\nI would like some Advice on this as to:\r\n- How should I tune MPC Params in order to avoid the Oscillation when braking in PosCTL?\r\n- Why were the Setpoints of Roll/Pitch kind of \"sleeping from 3:57 to 3:58.5?

So it is logical that the ramp up of the quad in the back transition go from 0 to hover throttle in order to hold the MC at current altitude (the idea behind Position mode) and continue like this up to the end of transition then pass the throttle to the MC to continue in Position mode until it stops.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for the back transition ramp up commanded throttle PX4 uses VT_TRANS_THR which is the throttle for the front transition pusher motor. \r\n\r\nYou can see it clearly in:\r\n\r\nMission\r\n![mission back tr thrust comanded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12617619/34905059-dbb58ea4-f859-11e7-8af5-8b617b05eb57.png)\r\n\r\nLOG: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e6381c08-4b42-41f2-a01b-bd9f7f0bbb58\r\n\r\nPosition\r\n![position back tr thrust comanded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12617619/34905110-f9bab6ee-f85a-11e7-93a4-b2d198cb38dc.png)\r\n\r\nLOG: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=66fa60a2-e7b4-487e-b916-3c45f024daf3\r\n\r\nWe could not see this up to now because we had a 3 sec back transition with 3 sec ramp up and with pretty low VT_TRANS_THR = 0.7 .\r\nNow because we fight the fron transition ramp up problem #8664 we made the VT_TRANS_THR = 0.9 and found out that during the back transition in Mission and Position modes the quad trhottle during the transition is so high that the VTOL just gains some 10-15 meters og height during the transition.

**uorb_index** from 0~n(multi sensor)\n\nbut look at the validator\n\nhttps://github.com/PX4/ecl/blob/bdbc05cf91e6b13e2033ee3a7ecd3bdbf6f22f09/validation/data_validator_group.cpp#L72-L81\n\nit's a singly linked list to group multi sensor, the **_first** is actually the last one we add to group, so i imagine a situation:\n    there are 2 mag sensor, publish *sensor_mag0* and *sensor_mag1* orb

Fix the generator script to match firmware implementation\r\n2. Change the PX4 implementation to use a simple matrix-style mixer\r\n\r\nSince the gain of each motor can be chosen in the geometry config file, and that the matrix-style mixing table is simpler and more intuitive, I would prefer to use the 2nd alternative.\r\nFYI @MaEtUgR @jlecoeur

This seems to be a regression in v1.7.0, older versions of the firmware worked fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8460","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8460/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8460/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8460/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8460","id":281684956,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODE2ODQ5NTY=","number":8460,"title":"individual

fixes the height gain bug that occurs when using hold/loiter mode after taking off without GPS and gaining it's use in-flight. Reported by https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8400\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a bug causing the  height in the mavlink global position relative_alt message to be AMSL instead of height above takeoff location if GPS checks pass after takeoff.\r\n\r\nThe practice of allowing use of hold and position change commands via GCS inputs after a non-GPS takeoff has wider implications. In such a scenario, both RTL and geofencing are disabled, the user may not be aware of this, and unlike flying using stick inputs, it would be easy for the user to inadvertently fly the vehicle to a range where comms are lost or recovery using stick demands is impossible. \r\n\r\nThis has been tested in SITL using the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1) Modify the SITL startup script to inhibit GPS lock by adding 'gpssim set -t 0' at the end\r\n2) Run 'make posix_sitl_default gazebo' and wait for the ekf to initialise\r\n3) Select 'altitud'e mode on QGC, arm and takeoff using throttle stick\r\n4) Enable GPS lock using 'gpssim set -t 3'\r\n5) Wait for EKF GPS fusion to start\r\n6) Select 'hold' mode on QGC and command a positive altitude change using the slider and confirm completion\r\n7) Command a position change on QGC using the 'fly to click' feature and confirm completion\r\n8) Command a negative altitude change using the slider and confirm completion\r\n9) Command  a landing at current location.\r\n\r\nLog file here:

Since previous setpoint is not always set in the navigator (which would be the correct solution) and the current setpoint updates continuously in mission due to yaw setpoints (which should be removed), the position controller uses a logic to set the current and previous setpoint.
