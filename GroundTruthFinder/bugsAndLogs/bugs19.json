(qshell does not work) and there is also no IMU data visible\n- in the shell of the dsp there are errors about symbols not being found\n![mini_dm_bad1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7610489/39805599-967ac218-5377-11e8-832a-ee14e32bce61.png)\n\n- there are also some krait errors appearing on the linaro side (will append a screenshot of that as well)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9444/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9441","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9441/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9441/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9441/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9441","id":321172420,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTg2NjIzNTgy","number":9441,"title":"Fix

PR solves two problems which I found during Cygwin Toolchain usage:\n\n- **astyle check passes in any case**\nThe shell script which checks the style relies on greping for the keyword \"Formatted\" in the output of astyle. But the program has localization support and will output in other languages e.g. german. This leads to all style checks always succeeding. I only tested this on Windows in Cygwin but I can imagine the problem also exists on non-english Ubuntu installations.\n**Solution:** is the parameter --formatted of astyle which only produces any output if there was something to fix. This allows for a display language independent condition for an empty string inside the shell script.\n\n- **Makefile colors do not work** e.g. `\\033[0;34mFormatting with astyle \\033[m`\nCertain terminal combinations like cygwin - mintty - xterm - bash do not escape colors by default.\n**Solution:** Force interpretation of backslash escapes with the parameter -e of echo.\n\nI also switched the colored messages to a lighter blue (94 instead of 34) because in certain terminals default blue is hard to read on black background while on linux both blues were easy to read (see pictures).\n\n![terminal1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/39757751-146deae2-52ce-11e8-8d97-4d014704a878.JPG)\n![terminal2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4668506/39757750-1453e606-52ce-11e8-82be-f0f1a8bac104.JPG)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9435","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9435/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9435/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9435/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9435","id":320989507,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTg2NDg4NDkw","number":9435,"title":"Optical Flow Use Improvements","user":{"login":"priseborough","id":3596952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough","html_url":"https://github.com/priseborough","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":10884840,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDg0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/enhancement%20(improvement)%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"enhancement (improvement) üí°","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":706033618,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDYwMzM2MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":27,"created_at":"2018-05-07T23:11:50Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T08:57:34Z","closed_at":"2018-05-22T22:05:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/9435","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9435","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9435.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9435.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"For discussion/comment\n\n**Addresses the following issues:**\n\nWhen the estimator is using optical flow as the only aiding source, the uncertainty in the position relative to the starting point will increase over time. At some point this will cause the position validity check to fail. This is unnecessary if operating in POSCTRL because the operator will be correcting for the drift throughout the flight. This PR sets the required hpos accuracy to INFINITY when using only optical flow in POSCTL.\n\nThe only way to maintain a constant height independent of baro drift when using flow was to use the EKF2_RNG_AID parameter, however this was originally designed for a limited use case where the vehicle performed a vertical launch and recovery and clibed above the max range finder use height before moving horizontally. When used for general flying, repeated switching between range finder and baro could result in the reference height datum ratcheting up or down. This PR transfers the responsibility for terrain following when reliant on optical flow to the position controller\n\nThere was no maximum height limit applied when using flow, so the operator could fly the vehicle high enough to lose navigation.\n\nRelates to

Here is a log from boot : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6628dc88-c567-4796-95a6-f0815ab1a535\n\nWould be great if you could have a look @priseborough @ChristophTobler!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9412","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9412/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9412/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9412/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9412","id":320315535,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTg2MDE0NjEz","number":9412,"title":"Avionics power check type error (int to float)","user":{"login":"dakejahl","id":37091262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkxMjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37091262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl","html_url":"https://github.com/dakejahl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakejahl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/24","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/24","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/24/labels","id":2491594,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ5MTU5NA==","number":24,"title":"Release v1.8.0","description":"Maintenance release","creator":{"login":"LorenzMeier","id":1208119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier","html_url":"https://github.com/LorenzMeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":195,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-05-01T13:29:33Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T07:16:58Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-07-13T13:37:16Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-05-04T15:18:51Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T08:57:39Z","closed_at":"2018-05-04T16:08:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/9412","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9412","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9412.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9412.patch","merged_at":"2018-05-04T16:08:56Z"},"body":"After a refactor inn #9193 a type error was introduced.

Bug Report\nWe (ASL/ETHZ) have recently had two hard faults that caused Pixhawk to reboot. One of them unfortunately happened in air with a 3.2m wingspan fixed-wing, one happened during on-ground testing.\n\n## Setup\n - Hardware: mRo Pixhawk (px4fmu-v3 / 2MB flash)\n - Firmware: Basically PX4FW v1.7.4, i.e. master-branch from 5 days ago (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/71170dce0a87ce06e00d721a713dfc3dc92dfc11) but with some slight modifications mainly to adapt the mixers to our platform and one custom sensor driver. The estimator is EKF2, the flight controller is the stock controller.\n\n## Hard fault 1: In-air\nWe had done 3 short MANUAL flights before that, and in this flight first flew manual for about three minutes and then switched to stabilized. The hard fault ocured 1 minute after switching to stabilized mode. The pilot continued to fly in PX4IO's (important!) manual override mode, and, as he barely noticed the issues, actually went back into stabilized mode for some time before then landing the plane following our instructions. The ulogger-log of part 1 (see below) stops in air. We could not find any fancy stuff in the logs before the log stops. Pixhawk rebooted in-air, and continued logging as usual (part2, see below).\n\n- Log files (with attached hard fault log) from take-off to in-air hardfault and pixhawk reboot: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=3b702655-6052-46e6-85e2-fd012d27c25f\n- Log file after the crash (i.e. after the pixhawk reboot until landing): https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=409fcb62-50ca-42d1-82c7-f1bcaccfe9fd\n- Telemetry logs:[2018-04-20 15-13-09.log](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934640/2018-04-20.15-13-09.log) (rename to .tlog!). The reboot happens after ca 1/3 of the log file length, you can see that it happened because the relative altitude is suddently zero or even negative.\n\n## Hard fault 2: On-ground\nThis happened during in-lab testing. We performed extensive pre-flight checks, including rebooting FMU (by pressing the reset button) and checking that IO's manual override still works. It did, but (and i assume this is normal because there is already a mixer present) loading the mixer after that provoked reboot fails. We let the plane then just sit there for a couple of minutes, and suddenly Pixhawk rebooted. This was a hard fault, too. We unfortunately assumed this was BECAUSE we had provoked the in-air restart via pushing the FMU reset button (and after testing for another 8 hours in-lab without any hard fault assumed everything was OK). I don't have the ulog-files yet, but i have:\n\n- The hardfault log from the SD card (it looks very similar to the one we saw in flight): \n[fault_2000_01_01_18_53_35.log](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934634/fault_2000_01_01_18_53_35.log)\n- The console output. Note again that this log starts after we provoked an FMU reset via pushing its reset button, that's why it is an in-air restart. \n[consoleLog.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934645/consoleLog.txt)\n\nI might be able to provide the firmware .elf file to allow debugging the hard fault as described in https://dev.px4.io/en/debug/gdb_debugging.html#debugging-hard-faults-in-nuttx if required.\n\nI guess it makes sense to add this to https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/9271 @RomanBapst @LorenzMeier

Today, we successfully reproduced it in a Gazebo simulation. It seems that we are capable of arming and taking off in offboard mode without any position (GPS or PX4Flow). Therefore, our commands (vx, vy, vz yaw_rate)  are ignored except vz.\n\nThe takeoff procedure is the following:\n- OFFBOARD\n- ARM\n- (Vx=0, Vy=0, Vz=3.0, yaw_rate=0) until a certain altitude.\n\nWhen the simulation is started from a certain time, it works perfectly (well straight takeoff) but when the simulation is just started, we can still go in offboard, arm and takeoff but additionally to the expected drift, the copter rotates to north (the gazebo simulation starts pointing east)\n\n- **Log**: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5477f120-408d-4ce5-82e1-3b3d695a3a03\n- **Expected behaviour**:\n  * The copter does not arm until GPS fix or PX4Flow fix\n  * If the copter arms, it should drift as the position is not fixed\n- **Behaviour**:\n  * The copter arms\n  * The copter drifts\n  * **The copter rotates around the yaw angle** \n\n- **Steps to reproduce the problem**:\n  * Start Mavros over UDP link\n    * roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=\"udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557\"`\n  * Prepare your OFFBOARD control method\n  * Start the simulation \n    * `make -j8 posix_sitl_default gazebo`\n  * Run your OFFBOARD control method\n\n- Results:\n  * The copter arms, but rotates from East to North and drifts until we see in the console of the simulator: \"EKF GPS checks passed (WGS-84 origin set)\" and \"EKF commencing GPS fusion\". \n  * The rest of the mission works fine.\n\n- Simulation console information:\n\n```\nINFO  [mavlink] partner IP: 127.0.0.1\nWARN  [mavlink] [timesync] Hard setting offset.\nINFO  [lib__ecl] EKF

-  fixes #9155\n\nThere were many issues. The most important immediate issue is that preflight checks haven't been blocking arming. Additionally many little annoying edge cases I've experienced finally make sense to me where you might not be provided appropriate (or any) feedback trying to arm.\n\nThere's still a lot more to do here, but this restores a level of sanity. The next steps from my perspective would be removing the actual sensor check calls from the state machine and centralizing all of it on the commander side. Then commander would simple pass the appropriate flags into a much simpler generated (and documented) state machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9193/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9176","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9176/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9176/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9176/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9176","id":309219110,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTc3OTI4NDA0","number":9176,"title":"commander

HMC5883 doesn't always start on boot and can not start from shell. Must reboot a few ties to get it enabled. HUD/artificial horizon and mag are frozen when not working and some other functionality also doesn't work when this occurs. (It's not hardware related since going back a few versions fixes it). Mixer freezes up too on the ailerons. Flaps don't respond correctly, to be clear that means flaps don't do anything and ailerons go full when using the flap switch (mixer I'm using is for the Albatross AAVVTWFF which ties the flaps and ailerons together when hitting the flap button but also tried it on a custom mixer here that is similar but with a few other inputs, same thing).

However in termios.h, the baud rate is encoded in a number of preset values, eg B57600. This affects the agent running on Ubuntu since the encoded value is different from the actual baud rate. As a result executing the following in Ubuntu terminal:\r\n./micrortps_agent -b 57600 -d /dev/ttyUSB1\r\nresults in this failure message:\r\nUART transport: device: /dev/ttyUSB1; baudrate: 57600; sleep: 1us; poll: 0ms\r\n\r\nERR SET BAUD /dev/ttyUSB1: 0 (22)\r\nClose UART\r\nEXITING...\r\n\r\nWith the problem corrected using an extra function to convert the baud rate to the encoded value, the behaviour shown in the  terminal is:\r\nUART transport: device: /dev/ttyUSB1; baudrate: 57600; sleep: 1us; poll: 0ms\r\n\r\nno flush\r\nsensor_combined publisher started\r\n\r\nNote that there may be a separate problem with the code generation for the agent application.
