problem solved by this pull request**\r\nThe rover position controller goes in a \"STOPPING\" state when the next waypoint is smaller than the loiter radius(set by `NAV_LOITER_RAD`): https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/5b44bd67bb37c91c0b15ceee70c873b8c0e28cfa/src/modules/rover_pos_control/RoverPositionControl.cpp#L233-L234 \r\n\r\nHowever, since the default is `NAV_LOITER_RAD=50` it effectly prevents from anybody planning a mission within a 50m radius from where the vehicle is. \r\n\r\nThis problem was not obvious since all vehicles in SITL were effectly

the bug**\r\nThe fact that we convert the current vehicle position to float precision in the fixed wing position controller results in a discretization error which leads to actuator jitter and roll oscillations\r\n\r\nThe bug will result in different things depending on if the vehicle is flying straight north/east or any other direction. If it is flying straight north/east there will be large step changes is xtrack error and if it is flying in any other direction there will be much more noise in the xtrack_error resulting in rate setpoint jitter which leads to ailron jitter.\r\n\r\nHere is a SITL flight using standard VTOL on master\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7795133/107649207-83084080-6c7d-11eb-8cc4-2ec8685e827a.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7795133/107649214-856a9a80-6c7d-11eb-8f12-271aeac7187f.png)\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nDon't convert the current position and waypoints to float in the fixed with position controller\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAfter making a PR on our fork I wanted to open one here but the fix will require changes also in the rover position controller since it is also using the L1 library, that is out of scope for me now so creating this issue instead\r\n\r\nFYI @tstastny This was the bug I mentioned a while back which leads to roll oscillations for a vehicle with very tight L1 tuning\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16823/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16823/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16822","id":806428935,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTcxODQ5MzQx","number":16822,"title":"ist8310:

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nEKF position resets not getting handled correctly in position mode.\r\n\r\nThe mapping itself was seprated out into a calls because it was reused for the experimental nudging implementation. The position resets which were handled correctly before now change the wrong setpoints and I adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe nudging has to be before any filtering, then these member setpoints which are essentially copies are not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nI had prepared functions to reset the position and velocity but didn't use them in the EKF reset event.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\n@bresch Could you please give this a quick spin?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nReport by @bresch :\r\n> While doing some nav failure sitl tests, I found that the EKF position

to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15141\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16652\r\n\r\nv1.11.0 of the PX4_Autopilot contained code in the ekf2-main.cpp module that set the ground effect flag if the vehicle was close to the ground, eg:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/21c82a48146fb8afc5a56263a5da21300ba3137e/src/modules/ekf2/ekf2_main.cpp#L1338-L1351\r\n\r\nThis functionality has subsequently been lost because the ekf2 module now uses the vehicle_land_detected.in_ground_effect message that does not anticipate a takeoff and set the flag accordingly, eg:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/8b0ec5a78e03514ade6f4ddd231f4db37f8ee500/src/modules/ekf2/EKF2.cpp#L398-L410\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed is to modify the logic used to set

does not start with the specified I2C bus type using Firmware 1.11.\r\n\r\nI have tried the PX4Flow on the PX4 1.11 firmware and there is an issue with the address being assigned.

Using firmware 1.11, start the PX4Flow by going into the MavLink Console and type '''px4flow start''' the error will show that there is not a specified bus.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen the

work if I put in the command\r\n```px4flow start -X -a 0x42```\r\nto set the address but I have to do this every time I turn the pixhawk on.\r\nI have feeling this issue is because the PX4Flow does

the bug**\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nWhile playing with the geofence on sitl I encountered  few issues regarding it :\r\n1. Altitude - while on geofence failsafe trigger hold mode I tried to change the altitude to be above the allowed geofence max altitude. The first time trying to do so it warned me about the altitude geofence and didn't go as high as I wanted it to, but then when I tried to give a new altitude command to go above the allowed max altitude it did reach my desired altitude, although it shouldn't.\r\n2.  I tried to breach the geofence and in geofence, none mode fly to a waypoint after the max geofence radius, later I switched back to geofence hold mode, and the mc flow back to a waypoint inside the allowed radius, as it should.\r\nThe problem was when I did it all the same when the altitude of the mc was above the allowed max altitude, the stayed in it's waypoint outside the allowed radius and didn't fly back to the allowed radius.\r\n3. Although the geofence mode was none, trying to upload a mission with a waypoint above the max radius failed due to geofence violation in one of the mission waypoints.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nfirst issue :\r\n1. Change geofence mode to hold, the max altitude to 50m (can be something else) and the max radius to 30m (can be something else).\r\n2. Change altitude to 60m. It should stop ascending a little above 50m and warn about geofence violation.\r\n3. Change altitude to 60m. It should get to 60m while warning about geofence violation\r\nsecond issue :\r\n4. Change geofence mode to none.\r\n5. Fly to a waypoint outside the max radius.\r\n6. Switch the geofence mode to hold.\r\n7. see the error.\r\n\r\nthird issue :\r\n1. change geofence mode to none.\r\n2. try to upload a mission with one of its waypoints outside the max radius.\r\n3. mission check will fail due to geofence violation in one of the waypoints.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nfirst issue : mc shouldn't go above the allowed altitude.\r\nsecond issue : mc should return to the allowed radius.\r\nthird issue : mission should be accepted.\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- [px4

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nWhen you lose GPS estimate and command an Orbit (not already running one) there's a null pointer exception:\r\n1. The flight task update is called because a task is running, current_task not null\r\n2. In the update, the vehicle commands handling gets called which can switch to a different task e.g. Orbit\r\n3. If no GPS is available Orbit activation fails, ~not yet sure why this results in no task running~\r\n**EDIT:** This is the expected behavior. When a task activation fails it switches to None. That's not perfect, possibly we could at least switch back to what was running before.\r\n4. There's other things called on `_flight_tasks` that access the `current_task` pointer\r\n5. The pointer access was guarded in every single case but people added more calls and ignored guarding which I did not see:\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/10411/files#diff-e300be601083c82735501dd851cd44f0bd564c5a88200e72e7a66a01a9f8c6a5R132\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/10746/files#diff-e300be601083c82735501dd851cd44f0bd564c5a88200e72e7a66a01a9f8c6a5R139\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nHotifx for 5.: Add missing safety guard for null pointer exception when accessing the current task but none is running.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nThis is fixed on master by fixing 2. which is the better way. See https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16484#discussion_r555846374 and the follow-up to it. I still have to check what causes 3. and if the issue is still there.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nWe found this issue luckily while bench testing a vehicle (without GPS). The hard fault was reproducible in SITL as a segfault and hence gdb debuggable. With this hotfix the vehicle goes into failsafe instead of crashing.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNote this was likely not found because it's a corner case. QGC doesn't allow commanding an Orbit without a position lock and I was not able to trick it in any way to work around that but commanded it in a different way.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\n- \"unable to reach heading within timeout\" error when loitering to altitude\r\n- \"hacky\" loiter position acceptance (1.2*loiter_radius)\r\n- MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TIME: param2 (heading required) not considered\r\n- exit via tangent (xtrack) broken for NAV_CMD_LOITER_TIME_LIMIT \r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\n- fix \"unable to reach heading\" bug when doing loiter to alt with heading wait \r\n- for loiter acceptance in fixed-wing, it is cleaner to use (loiter radius + L1 acceptance distance) to decide on acceptance, instead of the magic 1.2 factor in front of the loiter radius  \r\n- add ability of \"heading wait\" for NAV_CMD_LOITER_TIME_LIMIT (possible as mavlink/mavlink#1383 was merged)\r\n- enable exit via tangent (xtrack) for both NAV_CMD_LOITER_TIME_LIMIT and NAV_CMD_LOITER_TO_ALT, but let exit back to center connection as default\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral: \r\n- unify logic inside Navigator for NAV_CMD_LOITER_TIME_LIMIT and NAV_CMD_LOITER_TO_ALT\r\n--> reach position --> start loitering --> reach altitude --> start timer (if applicable) --> reach exit heading (if applicable) --> declare mission item reached.\r\n\r\n- bit of clean up in Navigator, as I find the current structure more complex than needed. E.g. the return of get_acceptance_radius() should either be what's set in the NAV_ACC_RAD for MC, or the L1 distance for FW, as simple as that (unless I missed something?).\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nSITL and flight tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nSome screenshots from a SITL mission (standard VTOL) with a Loiter_time with heading wait (3,4), where 4 is with tangential exit, normal waypoints (with big altitude diff between 6 and 7), and a Loiter_Altitude with heading wait and tangential exit path (9).

Request for Control Zero F7 fix for latest firmware\r\n\r\nHi there, \r\nThe problems I've faced are:\r\n1. Latest firmware bug for Control Zero F7 build\r\n2. No observed battery voltage and current readings\r\n\r\nI have a **Control Zero F7** FC, and after I've `make mro_ctrl-zero-f7` and upload the latest firmware, the board does not boot up and is not viewable on QGC, there is also a flashing red light seen on the board. However if I flash using http://px4-travis.s3.amazonaws.com/Firmware/master/mro_ctrl-zero-f7_default.px4, the board boots up fine with the startup tune.\r\n\r\nEDIT: **Working commit** is commit 48f125f150547a061ff97a90c6f39b7b6aba8512 and the current one that didn't work is commit 7c95e991568bcf5108d8136319bf4673238cb6e1.\r\n\r\nIn addition the previous firmware flashed had issues, I am unable to get the battery voltage and current readings even though I've use 2 types of power modules from mRo the **mRo Classic Power Module (BEC) 4S LIPOs** and the **mRo Power Zero**. I have tried it on the **Pixracer** and flashed with `make px4_fmu-v4_default` and there are battery voltage and current readings from the power modules so that should show that the power modules are working well.\r\n\r\nI'll add more observation when I get back to the office\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16541/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16536","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16536/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16536/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16536/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16536","id":783599029,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTUyOTMxNzAy","number":16536,"title":"tools:

EKF module uses true airspeed as published by the sensors module, however this is not corrected for scale factor errors that can be estimated by the wind estimator and corrected using the ASPD_SCALE parameter that is applied to the true airspeed published by the airspeed_selector module. The effect of a scale factor error, learned and applied by the airspeed_selector, but not on the airspeed as used by the EKF is shown below using data from a flight where the uncorrected scale factor in airspeed data used by the EKF resulted in a significant along track position error when dead reckoning without GPS:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1122\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-01-05 at 2 33 19 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3596952/103603550-fcb45c80-4f62-11eb-9efa-1ef343daa0e6.png\">\r\n\r\nThe innovations and learned wind states for the EKF (using uncorrected airspeed) and sensor_selector wind estimator (using scale factor corrected airspeed) is shown below and causes large airspeed innovations in the EKF.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1135\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-01-05 at 2 38 48 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3596952/103603952-eb1f8480-4f63-11eb-8129-4697015ef09a.png\">\r\n\r\nThis solution applies the same ASPD_SCALE parameter that the sensor_selector module uses. The alternative which was to use the airspeed_validated.true_airspeed_m_s data directly was rejected because it introduced the possibility for a circular dependency if the sensor selector was learning the scale factor using the EKF velocities and also was not compatible with future use of different airspeed sensors for different EKF instances.\r\n\r\nTesting was performed by flying the gazebo_plane sitl simulation in a loiter circle with ARSPD_SCALE_EST set to 1 to start airspeed scale factor calibration. After a few circles, ARSPD_SCALE_EST was set to 0 to turn off calibration and save the scale factor which changed from 1.0 to 0.947. The flight was repeated with ARSPD_SCALE_EST left at 0.

the bug**\r\nWe are using a Pixhawk Holybro V4 for a multicopter setup. It seems that the platform restarts mid-air which causes the vehicle to crash (Motors stop and the Pixhawk reboots immediately). These test flights are done in a MoCap environment and we are using the internal EKF2 by feeding the MoCap pose at 30Hz via the mavlink vision pose topic. Each individual flight produces 3 logfiles:\r\n\r\n- First file: Short ~4 second period\r\n- Second file: The longer flight period with the notification of a software error\r\n- Third file: A short ~4 second period again\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the smaller logfiles before and after the flight test but I attached them anyway. The second file however points out a software crash. We are using the latest and unmodified firmware release (v1.11.2) and I can not see a clear cause for the error in the log file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. We are using the internal EKF2 estimator and feed 30Hz MoCap pose information via the mavlink vision topic\r\n2. Takeoff and let the copter hover in position control for a while\r\n3. In our case, the Pixhawk restarts after 20 seconds or 2 minutes (this varies)\r\n4. Motors turn off and the multicopter performs a hard landing\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe PX4/Pixhawk V4 should not restart\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n\r\n- First file: Short ~4 second period\r\n  - https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=fab2c889-e3c8-4ff6-a6cf-6b5af31cd0ba\r\n- Second file: The longer flight period with the notification of a software error\r\n  - https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=a288b862-a60b-426c-af81-cf5b57629769\r\n- Third file: A short ~4 second period again\r\n  -

GPS is failed in SITL via the use of 'failure gps off' with the SYS_FAILURE_EN parameter set to 1, although the EKF correctly reports when it stops calculating a position and velocity estimate via the vehicle_local_position.xy_valid and stoppage of publishing the vehicle_global_position message, the vehicle_status_flags message delays the reporting of this via the condition_local_position_valid and condition_global_position_valid data.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add a check of the vehicle_local_position.xy_valid in addition to the check of reported position accuracy.\r\nIt also includes the updates to ecl that fixed inconsistencies in the navigation validity reporting when dead reckoning without GPS\r\n\r\nThis was tested in SITL using the 'make px4_sitl gazebo_plane'  with he follwoign parameter modifications\r\n\r\nEKF2_FUSE_BETA=0 to ensure a rapid loss of navigation when GPS is failed.

the bug**\r\nThe [GPS_STATUS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#GPS_STATUS) message is defined to contain the global satellite ID in the `satellite_prn` array. But the data we receive does not make sense at all (duplicate satellite IDs and IDs, which are not shown in uBlox U-Center).\r\n\r\nAccording to the uBlox protocol description, no PRN values are provided by the NAV-SAT and NAV-SVINFO messages. And there might be a big bug in the parser for these messages (see https://github.com/PX4/PX4-GPSDrivers/issues/63).\r\n\r\nThis issue should just keep track of the necessary changes to the rest of PX4, when the GPSDriver code is fixed. Because there two possible ways to ensure compatibility between the uBlox driver and the GPS_STATUS message when the PRN field is not filled by the uBlox driver:\r\n- either the MAVLink message should use `satellite_info.svid` when `satellite_info.prn` is empty\r\n- or the ublox driver must copy the `satellite_info.svid` to `satellite_info.prn` (to ensure backwards compatibility).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16363/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16361","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16361/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16361/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16361/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16361","id":760922749,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTM1NjY5NTYw","number":16361,"title":"ekf2: update to new ecl to fix fault status getter","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":10884840,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDg0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/enhancement%20(improvement)%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"enhancement (improvement) 💡","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":666022583,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjYwMjI1ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/EKF2","name":"EKF2","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-12-10T05:33:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:45:43Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T17:45:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/16361","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16361","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16361.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16361.patch","merged_at":"2020-12-10T17:45:41Z"},"body":" - estimator_status filter_fault_flags has exceeded 16 bits\r\n\r\nThe actual fault status was being clobbered.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nThree reported issues from pilots:\r\n1. It takes a long time (~5 seconds) until the position lock setpoint is set.\r\n2. Vehicle flies back to original position when moved on the ground in position mode.\r\n3. Vehicle takes too long to slow down to zero at the very end.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\n1. See 3.\r\n2. I made the `resetPosition();` function for exactly that purpose but in the end forgot to call it in the `activate()` function of the flight task -> added `_stick_acceleration_xy.resetPosition();` now like it was originally planned.\r\n3. It takes so long to brake at the end because acceleration = velocity_dot = k * velocity results in an exponential decay and has nice characteristics but when velocity reaches close to zero it takes an eternity to reach exactly zero. The solution I came up with is a continuous function that is linear above 1 and square root below 1. It's used to boost the brake drag in low speeds.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI tested in SITL and it gives really nice results. I suggest we try it on a real large vehicle before emerging as well, I'll organize that.\r\nI added unit tests for the  `sqrt_linear()` function.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFunction plot

The behavior when a takeoff waypoint was passed to a rover vehicle was:\r\n- The vehicle would not move since the waypoint was too close\r\n- The takeoff waypoint would not get accepted since rovers are not able to climb and reach the altitude\r\n\r\nI think it might be obvious that one \"should not\" pass takeoff waypoints to a vehicle. However, QGroundControl only lets you plan a mission that starts with a takeoff waypoint. While this should also be an improvement on the QGC side, I think it is still useful to handle this case on the vehicle side so that the vehicle can still progress with the mission even with a takeoff waypoint\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThis adds a special case when handling takeoff waypoints for rover vehicles. The acceptance radius is set to only consider horizontal distance to the waypoint, if the vehicle type is rover.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\n- This was tested in SITL gazebo, with the rover model.\r\n```\r\nmake px4_sitl gazebo_rover\r\n```\r\nThis log shows a full mission successfully finished starting with a Takeoff waypoint and finished with a RTL: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=25fe983b-44d0-4a11-a7c2-2ab9662c35d4\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16295","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16295/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16295/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16295/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16295","id":752661642,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI4OTM3ODg5","number":16295,"title":"microRTPS: remove byte ordering for nested types","user":{"login":"TSC21","id":5048656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDg2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5048656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21","html_url":"https://github.com/TSC21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSC21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":661334604,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjEzMzQ2MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/rtps%20(depreciated)","name":"rtps (depreciated)","color":"0087B3","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-11-28T11:53:32Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T11:05:43Z","closed_at":"2020-11-28T20:26:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/16295","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16295","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16295.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16295.patch","merged_at":"2020-11-28T20:26:51Z"},"body":"**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nOn the serialization/deserialization templates, `get_children_fields()` was returning the message fields ordered by the size of the data types, resulting on mismatches between the expect message structure and the received/sent message structure for nested types - this was identified by @mickey13 while using `position_setpoint_triplet` for offboard control.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nAlthough uCDR by default does buffer alignment, we currently don't have a straightforward way of changing the field ordering of the messages without breaking the way they are serialized/deserialized in Fast-CDR. Fast-CDR though has a faster mode that allows to do serialization without byte alignment, which can be used, though Micro-CDR doesn't have this mode implemented. So for now, we assume by alignment but no bandwidth optimizations at this point. This was initially removed in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12025, but not for nested types. This was now removed from the `get_children_fields()` functions as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n1. Not a reasonable solution, but still a solution: order all our msg fields in a more bandwidth optimized way. This would result in IDL files that would be common for both DDS and ROS 2 usage, and we would keep the same structure in uORB and IDL.\r\n2. Use `eprosima::fastcdr::FastCdr` instead of `eprosima::fastcdr::Cdr` in the agent side for disabling alignment, while looking for a clean way of doing the same in Micro-CDR (without hacking through it). The only concern here is that even though we might minimize the bandwidth consumption, this will result in an higher CPU usage due to not-aligned memory access when dealing with buffers.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions would require some trade study and measurements to understand which one fits our needs better. In the end, these could also be made as options to people exploring the tradeoffs in different ways.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nResulting `serialize_position_setpoint()` and `serialize_position_setpoint_triplet()` were compared for confirmation of the correct field ordering.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n[PX4 Slack

the bug**\r\nIt has been reported by several users that while flying in offboard the Pixhawk randomly changes to a different mode for no apparent reason, i.e. not due to offboard control failure, or sensor failure etc. Usually this change is extremely fast and the reason for is not registered in the flight logs making this issue quite hard to debug. In our case this mode change coincided with the mode that was set in the Pilot RC at the time, in this case ACRO, though @bperseghetti reported haaving the same issue in the past and it even happened without an RC on which seems to indicate it is not an RC issue. He also mentioned that this mode switch seemed random but it's still to be verified. @ThomasRigi also reported facing the same issue more than once and one time also in the kill switch.\r\n\r\nThis issue was discussed in PX4 Dev call on November 18th 2020: https://discuss.px4.io/t/px4-dev-call-november-18-2020/19554\r\n\r\nIt was first raised in slack here: https://px4.slack.com/archives/C0W2KUFFT/p1605613677266600\r\n\r\nSo far it has been reported on V1.09 and V1.10. No instances on V1.11 but most likely it's just from lack of usage. \r\n\r\nAll the logs will be provided further below.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUnfortunately this issue seems super hard to reproduce as it does happen quite rarely (@bperseghetti put it in the range of happening once every 150/200 flights). But the steps are to simply fly offboard often and for large periods of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe UAV should NOT exit offboard mode for no apparent reason, and while there are many reasons that could explain this mode change, for our current architecture the UAV would have changed into HOLD mode given our parameters, or in more extreme situations it could switch into either POSITION, ALTITUDE, or as a last resort into STABILIZED.\r\n\r\nA secondary issue is that even if the UAV is indeed changing modes, that should be explicitly recorded in the logs which is currently not happening as it seems that since it's such a quick change it goes in between the two log points.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n\r\n**Log 1** \r\nUAV changed from OFFBOARD mode to ACRO.

Add some hysteresis or more simply a timeout for the mode change. It really shouldn't matter for most of the user base if the mode change takes 50-100ms extra vs being basically instant. For the small use cases where this can be a concern perhaps this could be disabled via a parameter or even the precise timout period could be defined there.\r\n\r\n2. Throw an INFO message on mode change. If possible with the reason for mode change. It doesn't really solve this issue but it would help gather data to solve it in a different way in the future. IMO it also makes sense that this is enabled anyway.\r\n\r\n3. Change the message logging structure to ensure that no relevant data escapes the log in the presence of such a glitch.\r\n\r\n4. ???\r\n\r\nFYI @ThomasRigi @bperseghetti @dagar @MaEtUgR \r\n\r\nMany thansk in advance.\r\n\r\nP.s. @dagar We would especially like to ask if a fix regarding 1. could be fast tracked as there is a good chance that we are blocked from flying atleast we implement a solution, even if temporary. So this is quite high priority/critical from our side. Of course whatever help that you need just let me know and we'll help out in any way I can but I would assume it would just be changed in commander. If you do not have the bandwidth let me know and I can try to get a PR for you to review but in that case any pointers that you can provide would be helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16231","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16231/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16231/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16231/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16231","id":746422943,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTIzODIwMDQy","number":16231,"title":"ll40ls:

problem solved by the proposed feature**\r\nAt least one type of UAVCAN-enabled GPS unit (Here2) does not seem to be enumerating two GPS units, when they are plugged into CAN-1 and CAN-2 on the

Furthermore, the GPS unit seems to only function on CAN when it is plugged into the CAN-1 port. CAN-2 port seems non-operational, at least based on my testing. \r\n\r\n**Describe your preferred solution**\r\nThe preferred solution is that both CAN ports work to utilize UAVCAN GPS units (at least Here2), and that two UAVCAN GPS units can be used simultaneously. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},
