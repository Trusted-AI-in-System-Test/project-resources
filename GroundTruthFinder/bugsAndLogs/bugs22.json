This causes undefined and problematic behavior, especially with the aforementioned toolchain. It caused the rot matrix return to be different than expected, mag report values to drift, causing an increase in the innovation value of the ekf2 loop and signaling a fusion timeout, causing the estimated position to jump all over.\r\n\r\nI understand that this behavior might not show up when the config file is properly done, or when working with a full fledged ground control software, or with the specific native toolchain, but in my bare boned setup where I'm developing an offboard controller and a ground control of my own, it makes a difference. For me I just set the defaults of all the CAL_MAGX_ROT to 0 on ~/src/Firmware/src/modules/sensors/sensor_params.c, but a more appropriate fix could be made for the official repo.\r\n\r\nI've also been able to replicate the problem when compiling with gcc and running it on fc24.x86_64, mainly when printing several times in what should have been quick loops.\r\n\r\nDon't know if anybody will see this, but from my perspective code should never be dependent on the used compiler.\r\n\r\nPS: I'm a new developer and I'm sorry if I missed anything that would make this bug report useless.

But recently decided to reset all the parameters with the new defaults. For this we use change of air-frame procedure. So we carefully introduced our PIDs on top of the new defaults. We removed the circuit breaker for the airspeed and thus it did not ask us to calibrate the airspeed so the diff press cal params were empty 0.00. \r\n\r\nIn this setup we were not able to complete the transition. It never stopped the quad despite the speed got exceeding 20 m/s and the transition continued forever up to the crash.\r\n\r\nhttp://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=b6653ab1-ada7-4711-abaf-00a6a51249dc\r\n\r\nBecause we flew the 1.6.3 airspeed-less without a problem we just started thinking.

In airspeed-less mode the only way we could manage the transition is timing. \r\n\r\nThere is a parameter VT_F_TR_OL_TM which is supposed to guarantee fixed transition time without airspeed. But in reality in airspeed-less mode the transition is done now by the VT_TRANS_MIN_TM which is the minimum front transition time. The VT_F_TR_OL_TM did not have any effect over the transition timing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7545/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7544","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7544/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7544/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7544/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7544","id":241084159,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDEwODQxNTk=","number":7544,"title":"Unexpected

days ago I flown my multicopter for about 1.5 km. and almost got flyaway, only using RC saved it for safe landing. \r\nI got 'ALL DAT LINK LOSS' and it seems that RTL has been engaged (I still had downlink). but, instead of flying toward home position for landing the multicopter started to fly very fast backward.\r\nfrom the log I see that just after losing the datalink (at 10:28) it did got new heading, X and Y setpoints of home. but just after that (when the link was regained?) the position setpoint sets back to its current position, no change of heading setpoint. and the multicopter gets higher and higher pitch, that leads it to fly very fast backward, not closing the X and Y position setpoints.

the fixes in #7123, we still get motors spinning on unplugging the USB cable.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1. Plug in battery, USB cable\r\n2. Start QGroundControl\r\n3. Unplug USB cable\r\n\r\nIt only happens if QGroundControl has been talking to the PX4, as this triggers USB telemetry boolean that actually makes the PX4 reset after USB has been unplugged.\r\n\r\nI have looked at the PWM signal with an oscilloscope and have pictures of it, but they aren't very telling.\r\n\r\n**Workaround:**\r\nIn `src/modules/commander/commander.cpp`, find the `usleep()` just before the reboot and put `board_on_reset(0);` *before* the sleep. This sets all PWMs to zero.\r\n\r\nA better long term fix would be to add a sleep to the

a couple of months I am using a drone with Pixhawk and an onboard computer. Till now I had very few problems.\r\nI was using LPE  to fuse GPS and vision pose (this is working really fine), but I wanted to try the EKF2.\r\n\r\nI flashed, from QGroundControl, the latest stable version 1.6.2 on my pixhawk.\r\n* I set \r\n   * EK2_EVP_NOISE to the minimum value (0.01m) \r\n   * EKF2_GPS_P_NOISE to an high value (5.0m)\r\n   * EK2_AID_MASK to 9 (GPS and vision pose enable)\r\n   * EK2_HGT_MODE to vision\r\n* I am sending the vision estimate to the topic /mavros/vision_pose/pose.\r\n\r\nI tried this configuration in an environment with a not really good GPS signal, so even if the drone is not moving, the local state estimate is moving of several meters.\r\nWhat I want is that, whenever I have a pose from vision, the state estimate follows it instead of the GPS.\r\n\r\nI did several experiments with the drone fixed, and the outcome was always a state estimate that follow the vision estimate in Z but the GPS in X and Y.\r\nIf I disable the GPS on the EK2_AID_MASK then the state estimate follows the vision pose (as you can see in the first plot), but as soon as I re-enable the GPS then the vision pose is not trusted anymore (second plot).  \r\n\r\n![outside_gps_vision2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7209483/27083862-3c273ebc-504a-11e7-962b-f4369b163203.png)\r\n* second -52 activate vision pose\r\n* second -22 disable GPS in EK2_AID_MASK\r\n\r\n![outside_gps_vision3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7209483/27083875-48f2b6d0-504a-11e7-8c6a-d1f4905ca86f.png)\r\n* second -90 enable GPS in EK2_AID_MASK\r\n\r\nI am sure that the vision pose arrives and is listened by the filter, so it sounds to me a problem of covariances, but I really tried a lot of setups with the same result:\r\n - sending /mavros/vision_pose/pos_cov with tiny covariances\r\n - make the GPS covariance even bigger\r\n - put the vision pose covariance to 0 (kind of stupid)\r\n\r\nAm I missing something? \r\nSome parameters to set in order to make the vision trusted more (as with EK2_HGT_MODE for the Z coordinate)?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7408/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7405","id":235458301,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzU0NTgzMDE=","number":7405,"title":"1.6.2 VTOL RTL does not trigger back-transition","user":{"login":"bartslinger","id":8672355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzIzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger","html_url":"https://github.com/bartslinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartslinger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":249514594,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDk1MTQ1OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Hybrid%20VTOL%20%F0%9F%9B%A9%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%9A%81","name":"Hybrid VTOL 🛩️🚁","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":"Multirotor + Fixedwing!"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sanderux","id":14801663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAxNjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14801663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux","html_url":"https://github.com/sanderux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sanderux","id":14801663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAxNjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14801663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux","html_url":"https://github.com/sanderux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-13T07:19:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T15:59:48Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T15:59:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I think that this commit breaks the back-transition when RTL is commanded to a VTOL drone:\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/7249\r\n\r\nHowever I'm not 100% sure since my drone doesn't work with master or stable. @dagar suggested that this could easily be tested in SITL, although I don't have that setup at the moment.

After that between t=63s and t=69s, the drone is spinning around it's yaw axis and since it was loosing altitude, the thrust did reach saturation, without any RPM response.\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting a mixer saturation or an ESC issue. \r\n\r\nLink to the complete [log](http://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=55960095-7efd-4e28-8acc-1854828e75bc).\r\n\r\nFinally, my setup is a PixHawk Pro with Orel 20 ESCs and a mRo GPS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7261","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7261/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7261/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7261/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7261","id":229495390,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjk0OTUzOTA=","number":7261,"title":"Air frame init script files attempt to set rates that will fails on all FMU PWM","user":{"login":"davids5","id":1945821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDU4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1945821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5","html_url":"https://github.com/davids5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":581805812,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODE4MDU4MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/NuttX%20(OS)","name":"NuttX (OS)","color":"3C33E3","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-17T21:40:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T08:38:12Z","closed_at":"2018-02-21T13:05:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"There are 2 issue:\r\n1.

I did a test where I set a test point when the warning happens and connected the serial lines of the GPS to an oscilloscope with serial analyzer function.\r\nWhat I see is that the error immediately occurs after the configuration of the gps module (function GPS\r\nDriverUBX::configure).\r\nAt the end of the function the message MON_VER is polled but there is no wait for the answer. This should not be a problem and the answer is handled with the next “receive” in the main loop. As the answer of the MON_VER is long (payload 190 bytes), it seems that in this case the input buffer overflows (GPS_READ_BUFFER_SIZE = 128 Bytes) and some bytes of the MON_VER answer get lost. Therefore the ubx decoder of the FMU reads the beginning of the next NAV_PVT as pay load of MON_VER and the checksum is wrong. I think maybe this problem occurs only with newer ubx modules (ublox M8N) as the output of MON_VER is now longer. \r\n![ubx_crc_err](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18105084/25616957/fb549540-2f3f-11e7-9226-e0ef89e3a61d.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/7151","id":225071115,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTE4MTQ1MzIw","number":7151,"title":"Force PWM off on reboot on fmuv4","user":{"login":"davids5","id":1945821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDU4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1945821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5","html_url":"https://github.com/davids5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davids5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/22/labels","id":1812723,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTgxMjcyMw==","number":22,"title":"Release v1.6.0","description":"The main novelty of this release is a massive NuttX update adding support for STM32F7 and fault logging.","creator":{"login":"LorenzMeier","id":1208119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier","html_url":"https://github.com/LorenzMeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":126,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-07T06:51:16Z","updated_at":"2017-12-31T23:54:39Z","due_on":"2017-05-03T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-05-26T22:31:51Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-28T12:49:45Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T17:03:09Z","closed_at":"2017-05-03T06:33:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/7151","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/7151","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/7151.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/7151.patch","merged_at":"2017-05-03T06:33:06Z"},"body":"@bkueng -

But recently I've seen my copter loosing connection or something like that.\r\n\r\nHere's example of my log during flight:\r\n```\r\n[ INFO] [1491397206.779180203, 162.918000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ WARN] [1491397207.327585010, 163.442000000]: PR: request param #597 timeout, retries left 2, and 36 params still missing\r\n[ INFO] [1491397207.790462424, 163.870000000]: FCU: no offboard\r\n[ERROR] [1491397207.792956594, 163.884000000]: FCU: failsafe mode on\r\n[ INFO] [1491397207.838462636, 163.610000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ERROR] [1491397207.874603512, 163.958000000]: FCU: failsafe mode off\r\n[ INFO] [1491397208.059659872, 164.132000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ WARN] [1491397208.434182282, 164.474000000]: PR: request param #598 timeout, retries left 2, and 35 params still missing\r\n[ INFO] [1491397208.630911259, 164.652000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397209.184027414, 165.156000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ WARN] [1491397209.580750522, 165.542000000]: PR: request param #599 timeout, retries left 2, and 34 params still missing\r\n[ INFO] [1491397209.727710950, 165.678000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397210.286440749, 166.200000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ WARN] [1491397210.675576552, 166.550000000]: PR: request param #601 timeout, retries left 2, and 33 params still missing\r\n[ INFO] [1491397210.838900798, 166.702000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397211.409235549, 167.222000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397211.967874921, 167.730000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ WARN] [1491397212.474896209, 168.194000000]: PR: request param #602 timeout, retries left 2, and 32 params still missing\r\n[ INFO] [1491397212.529351061, 168.246000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397213.089556780, 168.772000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397213.663550895, 169.282000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397213.712743604, 168.854000000]: FCU: no offboard\r\n[ERROR] [1491397213.719005538, 168.854000000]: FCU: failsafe mode on\r\n[ WARN] [1491397213.970398260, 169.298000000]: PR: request param #603 timeout, retries left 2, and 31 params still missing\r\n[ERROR] [1491397214.050234544, 169.530000000]: FCU: failsafe mode off\r\n[ INFO] [1491397214.275384109, 169.808000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397214.849830352, 170.334000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ WARN] [1491397214.885008098, 170.366000000]: PR: request param #605 timeout, retries left 2, and 30 params still missing\r\n[ INFO] [1491397215.436646707, 170.854000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ WARN] [1491397215.987466251, 171.370000000]: PR: request param #606 timeout, retries left 2, and 29 params still missing\r\n[ INFO] [1491397215.987573803, 171.372000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397216.590532094, 171.906000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n[ INFO] [1491397217.134760945, 172.408000000]: current mode: OFFBOARD\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe message from **px4** firmware tells me that there's no **OFFBOARD** but at the same time when I check state from **MAVROS**, it says there is **OFFBOARD**. The copter then goes to **failsafe** mode and back again to **OFFBOARD** control which messes with overall control.\r\n\r\nSo I have no idea what's going on and if it's my fault or not. Has anybody any idea?\r\n\r\nThank you for any advice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/6973","id":219331879,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTE0MjA3MDE1","number":6973,"title":"Camera

are several outstanding issues with the camera trigger which might be causing very weird and hard-to-track problems due to direct hardware access.\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/6689 *[Could not reproduce]*\r\n> Scenario on Pixhawk hardware:\r\n> \r\n> Select Trigger mode \"Time based always on\"\r\n> Select Triggrer interface \"MAVLINK ...\"\r\n> After powercycle the autopilot does not boot.\r\n> Only workaround I found is to flash it with Ardupilot and then back to PX4.\r\n> \r\n> Reproducable on master@3961c46\r\n\r\n2. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/6839 **[Fixed]**\r\n> For some reason the trigger is not activated.\r\n> \r\n> In the QGC section for camera, it was by default set as PWM emitted on port AUX 5 and 6.\r\n> Considering I was need just 1 port (the NEX camera is activated by IR sensor, which work with PWM) to trigger the camera, I disabled the AUX5 and let the AUX6 on. For some reason the AUX6 has never emitted a signal during the whole flight, and the log confirm, nothing came out on port AUX6.\r\n\r\n3. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/6839\r\n> Any chance to set a PWM output for triggering a camera on an MAIN port instead of AUX to make it work?\r\n\r\n4. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/6703 **[Fixed]**\r\n> Configured PX4 on Pixhawk to do Time based trigger always on with:\r\n> TRIG_ACT_TIME: 500ms\r\n> TRIG_INTERVAL: 1000ms\r\n> TRIG_PINS: 123456\r\n> Expected to have equal PWM outputs on all 6 AUX ports.\r\n> This is what I get:\r\n> With RC transmitter ON:\r\n> AUX1: constant 1500 regardless of what is configured in Radio setup.\r\n> AUX2: constant 1500 regardless of what is configured in Radio setup.\r\n> AUX3: constant 1500 regardless of what is configured in Radio setup.\r\n> AUX4: constant 1500 regardless of what is configured in Radio setup.\r\n> AUX5: No signal\r\n> AUX6: No signal\r\n> With RC transmitter OFF:\r\n> AUX1: 1500 for 0.5s, 1700 for 0.5s (expected behavior)\r\n> AUX2: constant 1500\r\n> AUX3: 1500 for 0.5s, 1700 for 0.5s (expected behavior)\r\n> AUX4: constant 1500\r\n> AUX5: No signal\r\n> AUX6: No signal\r\n> \r\n> Turns out that I can get camera trigger working only while RC is turned OFF and only on two pins which does not make sense.\r\n\r\n5. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/6092 **[Fixed]**\r\n> I've been testing the camera trigger and haven't got it working on Pins 5&6 of the FMU (TRIG_PINS = 56). I've also tried the setting TRIG_PINS = 34 which works fine.\r\n> I'm wondering if there was a bug introduced somewhere because the default pins are in fact 5,6.\r\n\r\n6. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/4941 **[Fixed]**\r\n> The current approach of accessing PWM pins directly is suboptimal as it can conflict with the FMU driver's management of GPIO and PWM outputs. It would be good to coordinate on how to properly layer this.\r\n\r\n7. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/5437 **[Fixed]**\r\n\r\n8. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/5530 **[Fixed]**\r\n\r\nThe driver needs to ACK the TRIGGER_CONTROL command so that mavros knows the call succeeded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6961/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6957","id":218735747,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTg3MzU3NDc=","number":6957,"title":"PX4FLOW LPE not working: Z is reversed","user":{"login":"tomatac","id":15964070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY0MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15964070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac","html_url":"https://github.com/tomatac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":50,"created_at":"2017-04-02T01:58:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T16:20:49Z","closed_at":"2017-04-28T16:20:48Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I am trying to get a stable position estimation using only PX4FLOW but it looks like the Z axis is reversed. \r\n\"M1:OPTICAL_FLOW_RAD.distance\" is very stable around 1 m (based on sonar)\r\n\"M1:LOCAL_POSITION_NED.z\" variation is reversed relative to \"M1:OPTICAL_FLOW_RAD.distance\".
