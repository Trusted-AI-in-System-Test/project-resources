I ask the drone to take off to 5 meters it shoots aggressively up to 10 meters then comes back down:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18707114/24180121/4e9fbc48-0e70-11e7-8c1c-51aff459651c.png)\r\n\r\n[14-25-29-input.zip](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/860207/14-25-29-input.zip)\r\n\r\nLooking at the code in mc_pos_control, around line 1561 under the comment \"special thrust setpoint generation for takeoff from ground\" I see that it ramps up throttle all the way to MPC_THR_MAX if necessary in order to get the drone off the ground, and when it detects drone has reached MPC_TKO_SPEED speed then it switches to normal setpoint altitude hold.  The problem I see with this is that the GPS sensor is very slow, so it always cranks to MPC_THR_MAX for very agressive takeoff.  \r\n\r\nI want to fix this, but I could use some pointers.  I don't want any new parameters, we already have too many, instead I would love the code to be self tuning, for example, if I strap something heavy on my drone, it should \"just work\".  I assume that the current behavior came about because you also do not want the drone to \"hop\" during takeoff because then it thinks it has landed again and disarms.  \r\n\r\nBut clearly from the picture above, PWM shot all the way to up max throttle (90% of 1950 is 1755) before it even detected drone leaving the ground, then because the acceleration was so great, even with PWM falling quickly to 1283, the drone was essentially flung up to 10 meters.    What is very interesting is the red line I drew on the PWM signal.  Drone is still ascending quickly, and PWM is going up??? from 1283 to 1443.  I realize you don't want the drone to freefall, but there must be something wrong there.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to add a takeoff that is more gentle, like landing.  Where it slowly spins up the props just to get some idea of what it takes to get any vertical acceleration.  For example, when I look at the charts, z-mag responded 1 full second before GPS noticed any change.  In fact, z-mag was seeing something when PWM was way down at 1100.  This slow ramp up ensures safety, if anyone is near they will back off before it shoots up into the air.  So from there it should ramp up quickly to HOVER_THROTTLE + some delta, where that delta is self tuning.  This sudden ramp will cause a hop, but to keep it in the air we need more than hover throttle, so it can start more aggressively to ensure no hops, but then it will write a private setting to calibrate this value so that the next take off will be smoother and smoother each time you try it.  This is a little bit like auto-tuning a PID algorithm I suppose.\r\n\r\nAny objections or better ideas ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6876/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6876/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6873","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6873/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6873/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6873/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6873","id":215888375,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTU4ODgzNzU=","number":6873,"title":"Offboard attitude control completely broken/unuseable","user":{"login":"anuppari","id":3847301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDczMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3847301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari","html_url":"https://github.com/anuppari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuppari/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":431515706,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MzE1MTU3MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/more_info_needed","name":"more_info_needed","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":30,"created_at":"2017-03-21T21:45:52Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T12:01:32Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T01:00:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I posted a similar issue in #6830 but got no response. I have now confirmed that it is not just in simulation, but also when the firmware is run on actual hardware.\n\nThere are large delays between when an attitude setpoint is set and when the px4 begins tracking the setpoint. See the images below. Note that I am comparing the setpoints the px4 itself is sending back over mavlink (via the setpoint loopback topic in mavros) to the actual attitude via a mocap system. This rules out any issue in ROS/mavros/mavlink/telemetry communication between companion computer and px4. Also, the mocap has a low latency connection to the plot computer, whereas mavros is over wireless, so the actual delay is even larger than what it noted below.\n\n![lag1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3847301/24171850/aa2a9a30-0e4b-11e7-86ee-d43ff57b0e03.png)\nObserve the time period 1283-1285 seconds, where the x coordinate of the orientation (gold) steadily decreases, but the actual copter (blue) does not respond for 2 seconds!

I did not have stable hover before, but since I have just flashed these codes for Pixhawk and Px4Flow using masters I feel that I am doing that part correct. @andre-nguyen @ChristophTobler suggested me to check for orientation.

This problem was also reported in atomatic flight modes.\r\n\r\nDigging into it @Stifael and I found out that the velocity controller looses close tracking because of the tilt angle limitation while the setpoint goes to your high valued cruise velocity. Now if you want to stop or fly the oposite direction again, the slew rate prevents the fast setpoint change and the vehicle shows no reaction at all at least for the time the velocity setpoint is still higher than the actual velocity.\r\n\r\nHere is a plot showing this effect with high cruise velocity of > 10m/s, a very small maximum tilt angle of 10 degree to clearly show the problem, and a reasonable maximum acceleration of the same value as the crusie velocity > 10 m/s^2.\r\n<img width=\"1163\" alt=\"angle_delay2\"

all.\r\n \r\nI recently bought Pixhawk Mini. Currently, I am setting the hardware to establish ROS-Pixhawk-GCS system.\r\n\r\nIn the previous Pixhawk it provided TELEM2 port which can be connected to the ROS-computer directly. However, Mini provides only one TELEM1 port which is assigned for Wifi-module now. The last port I can use is the port with 'Android'? cable used when bootloading. I successfully increased the stream rate of that port by adding a file to the SD card in /etc/extras.txt.\r\n\r\nThe content is as follows :\r\nmavlink stream -d /dev/ttyACM0 -s HIGHRES_IMU -r 200\r\nmavlink stream -d /dev/ttyACM0 -s LOCAL_POSITION_NED -r 200\r\nmavlink stream -d /dev/ttyACM0 -s ATTITUDE_QUATERNION -r 200\r\n\r\nWith that file, Mini now provides high frequency data about 170hz with the 'Android' port.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to connect Mini from QGC, it shows no response at all although I connect my wifi well with low ping.\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the extras.txt file again, QGC can communicate with Mini very well.\r\n\r\n1. Any idea how I can change the stream rate without affecting the Wifi module(TELEM1)?\r\n2. As I know, The 'Android' port is assigned with ttyS0 and the TELEM1 port is ttyS1. But all people I saw use ttyACM0. When I tried to use ttyS0 instead of ACM0 in extras.txt file, it failed.\r\n\r\nThank you for time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6630/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6623","id":208901329,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDg5MDEzMjk=","number":6623,"title":"Landing initialization","user":{"login":"Stifael","id":13449161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDQ5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13449161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael","html_url":"https://github.com/Stifael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stifael/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1200459484,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAwNDU5NDg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-02-20T14:51:28Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T21:33:22Z","closed_at":"2019-02-13T13:19:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"1.)

So then I thought it was the ext compass so I switched it to a 5883 I've used before. Same issue. I then did this with another Pix1 and a 3DR Pix1. All the same result.

It is fairly random when it occurs, sometimes it \r\n    happens on the second upload sometimes on the sixth or seventh but it is repeatable.\r\n\r\nOccurs on multiple pixracers.\r\n\r\n\r\noriginal post - http://discuss.px4.io/t/pixracer-board-lockup-in-flight/2232/19","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/6410","id":202277190,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTAyNTYyMDM0","number":6410,"title":"Fix bug causing constant publishing of sensor corrections","user":{"login":"priseborough","id":3596952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough","html_url":"https://github.com/priseborough","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-21T00:52:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T07:31:58Z","closed_at":"2017-01-21T07:31:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/6410","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/6410","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/6410.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/6410.patch","merged_at":"2017-01-21T07:31:57Z"},"body":"The exisiting logic used to determine if new sensor corrections should be published used a one degree change in sensor temperature as the trigger.

of issues and concerns which I had while upstreaming the GPS-VIO interface which will also allow an offboard estimator to use the GPS accuracy information: \n\n1 . This is from the `vehicle_gps_position` topic : \n\n```\nfloat32 s_variance_m_s # GPS speed accuracy estimate, (metres/sec)\nfloat32 c_variance_rad # GPS course accuracy estimate, (radians)\n```\n\nFor velocity, variance should be in (m/s)^2 and for course, in rad^2. The comment and field name are both incorrect, and it is not understandable whether we want variance or standard deviation here.\n\n1. From the mavlink message `GPS_INPUT` : \n\n```\nspeed_accuracy float GPS speed accuracy in m/s\nhoriz_accuracy float GPS horizontal accuracy in m\nvert_accuracy float GPS vertical accuracy in m\n```\n\nThe units suggest that these are standard deviations, however field spec is not clear from the word \"accuracy\". Judging from other messages with better docs e.g `WIND_COV` (horiz_accuracy float Horizontal speed 1-STD accuracy), it means sqrt variance.\n\n1. Is there an objection to switching the `vehicle_gps_position` topic to covariances only (`pos_cov` and `vel_cov`), and derive the other uncertainty fields where needed? Seems kinda unnecessary to transport `hdop`, `vdop`, `epv`, `eph`, `s_variance_m_s`, `c_variance_rad`, etc. Also, modern estimators and any cascaded setup will benefit from the covariance availability. @LorenzMeier\n\nI will send in a PR with the fixes and the new interface when as my concerns are confirmed by another pair of eyes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6275/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6274","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6274/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6274/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6274/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6274","id":199429380,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTk0MjkzODA=","number":6274,"title":"SITL home altitude","user":{"login":"sanderux","id":14801663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAxNjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14801663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux","html_url":"https://github.com/sanderux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-01-08T15:59:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T01:01:17Z","closed_at":"2017-04-12T01:01:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I am testing some relative vs absolute altitude mission items but there seems to be an issue with SITL and the absolute altitude.

(i believe its because of backup and restore of settings).\r\n\r\nI flashed Ardupilot stack via Mission Planner and used QGC again to flash PX4 stack again and this time I only selected \"Generic Quadrotor X config\". It seems everything working for now.\r\n\r\nSince I am new to PX4 stack and QGC, I don't know what is failing and causing the issue, how selecting a menu item is affecting hardware?\r\n\r\nI can provide logs if someone needed, or reproduce the issue with specific ways if asked. I wish everyone a Happy New Year. Kind regards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6184","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6184/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6184/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6184/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/6184","id":197632953,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTc2MzI5NTM=","number":6184,"title":"Pixracer has incorrect gyro device ID on some sensor_gyro messages","user":{"login":"priseborough","id":3596952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough","html_url":"https://github.com/priseborough","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priseborough/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":416735878,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTY3MzU4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/board:%20pixracer","name":"board: pixracer","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-27T01:46:11Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T11:37:25Z","closed_at":"2017-04-03T11:37:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Description**\r\n\r\nWhilst testing a prototype IMU thermal compensation algorithm here: https://github.com/priseborough/Firmware/tree/sensor_correction-wip\r\n\r\nIt was noticed that the sensor_correction message occasionally contained an invalid device ID value for the voted gyro when displayed over the nsh console using the listener app .

It should be the ID for the ICM-20608 or the MPU9250 gyro.
