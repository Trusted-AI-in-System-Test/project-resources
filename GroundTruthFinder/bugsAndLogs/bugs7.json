To fix such issue, I think that PX4 needs to check the valid range of the parameter or something else.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe GPS failsafe is triggered.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=a5823c45-07e5-43f5-9227-e8493ae89e54\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=05fd86e9-3f3f-48c7-aa4f-117894ce26a3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/16113","id":735480375,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzU0ODAzNzU=","number":16113,"title":"V1.11.1: GPS over UAVCAN not detected","user":{"login":"ThomasRigi","id":48206725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjA2NzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48206725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasRigi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasRigi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":581916348,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODE5MTYzNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/uavcan","name":"uavcan","color":"2201AE","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2020-11-03T16:49:13Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T15:55:14Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T15:55:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nThe GPS+Magnetometer unit (Here 2) does not get recognized over the CAN bus upon boot up on a Pixhawk 4 with v1.11.1 and UAVCAN enabled.\r\n\r\nUnplugging and replugging the GPS unit without rebooting the Pixhawk makes it magically appear. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Switch the Here 2 unit to CAN mode and connect it to the Pixhawk 4 over either CAN1 or CAN2 port\r\n2. Power the Pixhawk 4. Enable UAVCAN by setting UAVCAN_ENABLE to either automatic or manual config (1 or 2)\r\n3. Reboot the Pixhawk\r\n4. Observe the missing GPS. For example, in QGC's Mavlink Inspector there's no GPS_RAW_INT message and typing \"uavcan status\" in the mavlink console shows all empty in the gnss and mag fields.\r\n5. Unplug and replug the GPS \r\n6. Wait a few seconds. You should now see the GPS_RAW_INT messages appear in QGC. \"uavcan status\" in the mavlink shell will also have found the GPS unit.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe device should be discovered directly upon first boot without having to physically replug it.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nI don't know how to get a useful log of this.

the bug**\r\nWhen we are performing a VTOL transition with a tailsitter type drone We are getting very weird thrust fluctuations.

I've added that line between adding gazebo to source list and installing gazebo.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nNo alternative solutions found, it's pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nRemove `gazebo11` and `libgazebo11-dev` packages, then removed `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list` file and run `apt-get update`.

this is the right solution but I was able to start up the simulator. Perhaps this file got deleted at some point and the deletion got pushed to master?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15916","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15916/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15916/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15916/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15916","id":717339058,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDk5OTE3NDkw","number":15916,"title":"mavlink: streams check tx buffer before send","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":10884840,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDg0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/enhancement%20(improvement)%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"enhancement (improvement) 💡","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1450324872,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDUwMzI0ODcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Communication%20(MAVLink)%20%F0%9F%93%A1","name":"Communication (MAVLink) 📡","color":"f66608","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-10-08T13:20:10Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T14:47:38Z","closed_at":"2021-01-10T17:35:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":true,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/15916","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15916","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15916.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15916.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"In the PX4 mavlink module we check the serial TX buffer (FIONSPACE) in the send helpers, but unfortunately this happens after each stream has already gathered all data to transmit and copied it into the mavlink message.

With NSH motor_test, (motor_test test -m 4 -p 20) the motor does not start as well. However using motor_test test **-m 5** -p 20, the motor spins and seems to be controllable.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nOn Pixhawk 3 Pro (fmu-v4pro) and maybe other boards (fmu-v2 and fum-v3), the internal RGB led is not working with v1.11.0 and later. A ncp5623c rgb led driver is used on the internal I2C bus, but the driver is never started on the internal bus. So the rgb led don't work. This driver is only started from the rcS file on the external I2C bus.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this problem is coming from the commit ec2de33547a0f29a3280849b514bdc63f0797f2e. The rgbled and the rgbled_ncp5623c start command have been replaced by a external start command in the rcS file but only the rgbled internal start command has been added in rc.board_sensors.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't know which boards use the rgbled_ncp5623c driver, so I added the start command on the same files at the problematic commit.\r\n\r\nProbably related to https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/14886\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nAdd a \"rgbled_ncp5623c start -I\" on fmu-v2, fmu-v3, fmu-v4pro rc.board_sensors files.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nOnly tested with a Pixhawk 3 Pro.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15711","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15711/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15711/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15711/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15711","id":697253804,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTcyNTM4MDQ=","number":15711,"title":"Rover no longer supported?","user":{"login":"nikored","id":36747712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzQ3NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36747712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored","html_url":"https://github.com/nikored","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikored/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":647657056,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDc2NTcwNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Rover%20%F0%9F%9A%99","name":"Rover 🚙","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":"Rovers and other UGV"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2020-09-10T00:04:28Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T08:24:28Z","closed_at":"2021-02-02T08:24:28Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I've loaded the lastest Firmware version (1.11.0) in a Pixhawk board and, when I tried to choose a \"Rover\" frame, the option did not show up.

version?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15695","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15695/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15695/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15695/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/15695","id":694566632,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDgwOTI3MTE2","number":15695,"title":"Jenkins:

the bug**\r\nThe weather vane does not work anymore in Mission (MC mode). Neither does MPC_YAW_MODE have an effect on the heading. So the drone ends up flying in all directions with the same heading, which is ugly to watch and can be dangerous in high winds. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nTested in SITL on v1.11.0:\r\n1. Launch Gazebo with `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol__windy` (by default 4m/s wind from South to North)\r\n2. Execute some mission which contains navigation in MC mode (e.g. [Dummy_MC_loop.zip](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/5162328/Dummy_MC_loop.zip))\r\n3. Observe the heading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAs stated in the docs (https://docs.px4.io/master/en/config_vtol/vtol_weathervane.html#mission-mode-behaviour). The drone should head into the wind. Also, MPC_YAW_MODE should behave as for a normal MC. I'm open to discussion whether the weather vane should have precedence over the heading calculations of MPC_YAW_MODE or not or if both should be active at the same time and you end up with a compromise. But certainly not changing the heading at all is not good.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=41546a93-eaeb-45c8-af75-fcfd2af6b967 : always heading east, neither weathervaning nor heading towards waypoint.\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=5cd8b35e-390b-476c-85fb-30ac2fd3ff42 : high winds on a custom branch with minor modifications from v1.11-beta.

problem solved by this pull request**\r\n@cmic0 tried to change `BAT1_V_EMPTY`. Parameter was changed, it differed from `BAT_V_EMPTY` and after a reboot (starting simulation again) it was back to the old value.\r\n\r\nBattery parameter migration from `BAT_*` to `BAT1_*` had the following issues:\r\n1. In simulation the `SimulatorBattery` broke the chain of ModuleParams parent/child tree which the logic is relying on. Additionally it overwrote the parameters with hardcoded values internally.\r\n1. The parameter migration prefers to migrate old over new if the values differ on boot but the flag `_first_parameter_update` was initialized false and hence always false. This didn't have an effect most of the time because the `previous_old_val` is zero on initialization and if the new parameter isn't zero it went the right path.\r\n1. Some drivers using the battery class e.g. INA266 didn't clear the `parameter_update` subscription once they checked it's updated.\r\n1. Some parts were hard to read.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\n1. Remove `SimulatorBattery`, it only did harm.\r\n1. Initialize `_first_parameter_update` with true.\r\n1.
