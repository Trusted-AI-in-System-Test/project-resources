enabling flaperons (spoilerons) and assigning them to aux 2 it works perfectly for auto landing. It's actually spot on. The problem is that it changes the centre pwm value from 1500 to 1420 for the ailerons. Tested multiple times, multiple type of servos and multiple versions of the firmware. If you mechanically centre your ailerons at 1500 pwm during setup it become an issue because after the fact you need to reset them to be centered at 1420 and adjusting this by trim shouldn't be the fix. It's easy to recreate, just load up a plane with flaperon support (flaps, ailerons in the mixer) and don't assign the flaps or aux2 to a channel.. Ailerons will be centred at 1500. Open QGC and set aux2 and flaps to channel 9 and it will instantly change down to 1420. It's an easy mechanical fix but beyond being a bit of an annoyance, I can't seem to understand why it is occurring.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4602","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4602/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4602/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/4602/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4602","id":156147197,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzA5NzQzODI=","number":4602,"title":"px4iofirmware: fixed a bug with override handling","user":{"login":"LorenzMeier","id":1208119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier","html_url":"https://github.com/LorenzMeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":289822068,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODk4MjIwNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/pixhawk","name":"pixhawk","color":"009800","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-05-22T11:15:55Z","updated_at":"2016-12-26T15:23:38Z","closed_at":"2016-12-26T15:23:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/4602","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4602","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4602.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/4602.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"this fixes a race condition between the DMA completion handler\nupdating registers in px4io and the mixer used for handling the\noverride state.
