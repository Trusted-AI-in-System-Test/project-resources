First here’s my setup:\n\n- Pixhawk Cube\n- Authorizer is a Linux board running pymavlink using v2 dialect\n- Param COM_ARM_AUTH = 1280001 (require one arm, 5s timeout, authorizer sysid 1)\n- Param COM_ARM_MIS_REQ = 2 (require auth but not valid mission)\n- Arming via Qground\n\nI can go into more detail on the setup if needed, but all the basics appear to be working. When arming I see the COMMAND_LONG 3001 arrive in the python script, and I have even rebuilt PX4 for the Cube to check that the COMMAND_ACKs I send to it are being received in the mavlink module. Here is the behavior I observe:\n\n- After reboot of Cube, the first arming attempt fails. It appears to fail even before the first COMMAND_ACK (with result MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS) reaches the arm_auth module via uORB\n- Subsequent arming attempts succeed, but they appear to rely on acks that are still queued from the first attempt. I have tested killing the python script after the first arming attempt (fail) and the second attempt still succeeds, despite no new acks being sent.\n\nHere is a snippet showing what the python script does:\n```\nin_msg = self._mav_sock.recv_match(blocking=False)\n  if in_msg != None:\n    if in_msg.get_type() == ‘COMMAND_LONG’:\n      self._mav.command_ack_send(3001, 5, 255, 5, 1, 1) # in progress\n      self._mav.command_ack_send(3001, 0, 255, 5, 1, 1) # arm cmd, accept\n```\n\nA log probably isn't that helpful in this scenario but here it is anyway:\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=bb57f1ee-6991-4190-b62b-6d2bdc7d013d\n\nHere's the nsh listener output showing that auth fails before my acks arrive (on this run I rebuilt PX4 with extra debug messages):\n[arm_auth_debug_fail_on_first_auth_attempt_txt.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3495153/arm_auth_debug_fail_on_first_auth_attempt_txt.txt)\n\nPlease let me know what additional info would help.\n\nThis was also posted on the forum here: https://discuss.px4.io/t/arm-authorization/12383","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12674","id":478992114,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzA1OTk0Mzcx","number":12674,"title":"uORB::PublicationQueued don't unadvertise on destruction","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-08-09T13:39:03Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T16:45:07Z","closed_at":"2019-08-09T16:45:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/12674","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12674","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12674.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12674.patch","merged_at":"2019-08-09T16:45:03Z"},"body":"Last night it occurred to me some of the stack allocated `uORB::PublicationQueued` usage is probably bogus for vehicle_command and vehicle_command_ack because the destructor unadvertises.\r\n\r\nExample: `commander takeoff`\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/d70b024ec7a6d72de87f4ddc7de087d716929144/src/modules/commander/Commander.cpp#L269\r\n\r\nOne quick hack that came to mind is to simply skip the unadvertise (which only changes the internal published flag anyway).

PR take up https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/12455  and https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/12626 (mission yawing timeout) and should improve the user experience/safety of VTOL forward transitions in mission mode. It only affects both VTOL_TAKEOFF and VTOL_TRANSITION commands.  \r\n\r\n**Issues**\r\n1) Before a VTOL_TRANSITION to fixed-wing, the heading needs to be aligned to the next waypoint, otherwise it won't start transitioning. This is a problem when weather vane (WV) is active, as then the heading is always aligned against the wind. Currently the transition thus does not happen with cross/tail wind.  \r\n2) https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/12626 (mission yawing timeout)\r\nEven with WV disabled, when flying with high cross/tail winds, the aerodynamic passive yaw stability always yaws the VTOL into the wind. If this effect is bigger than the maximum yaw control authority, then yaw setpoints can't be followed. This can then be a problem if a transition is not planned against the wind. In this case, if the vehicle can't reach the transition heading, the mission should be aborted and RTL. The time the vehicle has max time to reach transition heading is set with MIS_YAW_TMT (a negative value disables this timeout). Currently this timeout does not work,  so keeps trying indefinitely to reach the heading.\r\n\r\n3) The direction of the front transition at a VTOL_TAKEOFF waypoint (this waypoint is the one that per default gets selected for the first waypoint of a VTOL mission) is currently in an arbitrary direction with weather vane enabled (resp. the heading from takeoff is kept if weather vane is disabled).\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n1) This PR disables the WV during a VTOL_TRANSITION (to fixed-wing) as soon as the transition altitude is reached and the aligning phase starts. WV stays enabled (if WV_EN params is set to 1) for all other hover flight phases. \r\n2) Fixed yawing timeout in navigator (timer was wrongly reset all the time).\r\n3) Set the heading of the front transition of a VTOL_TAKEOFF to this VTOL_TAKEOFF waypoint. This heading is then enforced, meaning that like with a normal VTOL_TRANSITION wp, it won't do the transition if the aligning times out (controlled with MIS_YAW_TMT).\r\n\r\n**Follow-up issues to solve**\r\n- explain in QGC that for a VTOL_TAKEOFF, the direction of the transition is towards this waypoint and that it should be placed some distance from home and in the direction where one wants the transition to happen (it has to be accepted in FW mode and thus the vehicle will in worst case turn back to fly through it if it is too close to home)\r\n- give the user the possibility to set the direction of a VTOL_TAKEOFF to e.g. a fixed heading, or to discard any heading setpoint and just transition (e.g. into wind if WV is enabled).

This feature is necessary for VTOLs during front transition, as we then want a heading enforced (not transitioning in arbitrary direction), but yaw authority on a VTOL is usually limited in windy conditions. \r\nIf the current mission is aborted, the user should then plan a new one where the transition points into the wind. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSet MIS_YAW_TMT to something !=0. \r\nPlan mission with (seperate) VTOL transition (not VTOL takeoff, as then heading is not enforced).\r\n(In sitl, when MIS_YAW_TMT is set to 1 and the vehicle has to turn eg 90°, it should abort as it doesn't manage that in 1s)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAbort mission when the vehicle can't align with yaw setpoint at transition point within MIS_YAW_TMT.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI think that the problem is that the counter responsible for measuring the yawing time at the transition wp gets reset all the time, and thus does never reach above MIS_YAW_TMT. It gets reset because _waypoint_position_reached is reset to false after every time is_mission_item_reached() is executed (mission_block.cpp).

Then I started with airframe setup and sensor calibration. First gyro was calibrated without any issues and I continued with accelerometers. There, I just got the following errors over and over again, no matter what orientation of IMU selected: \"Error : invalid orientation.\". I then had a glance at the flight view with the artificial horizon and witnessed that the horizon has settled at around -178 degree roll though the FC has been laying around flat. Whenever I move the fc it drifts quite a lot and calibration of mag and acc sensors is impossible because of that. \r\n\r\nI also tried to flash a stable version but the behavior is the just the same. I'm kinda lost what to do. As a test if some sensors are dead I reinstalled Arduplane and verified if I can calibrate the sensors - which I could.

In that case the same command will be put into the queue again. That itself is not a problem, however, if the command is not acknowledged on those instances then the command will be re-sent after the timeout has passed to ALL other instances (including the one

every 2000ms\r\nTRIG_INTERFACE 3 -> send trigger message via mavlink\r\n\r\nEnable Telem2:\r\nMAV_1_MODE -> telem2\r\n\r\nPower the vehicle via usb or make sure that there is a mavlink instance running via usb.\r\nThis is important because we need at least two mavlink instances which send camera trigger messages.\r\nMake sure that there is something connected to telem2 which acknowledges the camera trigger commands.\r\nMake sure that there is nothing connected to the usb mavlink instance which acknowledges the camera trigger commands.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that the trigger messages received on TELEM2 do not come in regular intervals.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12548","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12548/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12548/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12548/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12548","id":472273536,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzIyNzM1MzY=","number":12548,"title":"Here

However, rather than following the setpoints (usually defined in local coordinates) it simply flies straight. \r\n\r\nThis seems to be because the fixed wing position controller blindly reads from the setpoints in global coordinates from the position_setpoint_triplets.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L854-L855\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Run SITL and start mission while streaming position_setpoints through mavros with setpoint_raw messages to takeoff and loiter\r\n2.

However, to use this a l1 like path tracking controller needs to be implemented on the companion side to make it usable. Being able to stream position setpoints to a fixed wing drone would greatly simplify the interface for robotic applications in fixed wing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12510","id":469755975,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Njk3NTU5NzU=","number":12510,"title":"ROI not performed in v1.9.2","user":{"login":"hangmann","id":4330259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzAyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4330259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann","html_url":"https://github.com/hangmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":78699954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODY5OTk1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Multirotor%20%F0%9F%9B%B8","name":"Multirotor 🛸","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-07-18T12:59:27Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T16:13:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi all,\r\nI am using a holybro pixhawk 4 with px4 version 1.9.2 (px4_fmu-v5_multicopter.px4). I wanted to try ROI by yawing the copter instead of a gimbal. \r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI noticed that ROI is not performed between two waypoints. Hence, the copter's nose is not pointing towards ROI, but instead towards the next waypoint. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior (with Airsim simulation):\r\n1. Uploaded mission in QGC (see attachment [mission.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/3406522/mission.txt))\r\n2. Started mission\r\n3. Took off\r\n4. See if ROI works\r\nObservations:\r\n5. Waypoint 1 is reached.\r\n6. Copter is oriented towards Waypoint 2\r\n7. Copter flies towards Waypoint 2 (nose headed towards it)\r\n8. Waypoint 2 is reached.\r\n9. Mission ended -> RTL\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe ROI from the exact same mission is performed as intended with the firmware 1.8.2: The copter's nose is pointing towards ROI while flying to Waypoint 2. Hence *Reproduce* step 6 should be \"oriented towards ROI\"\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- I first noticed the behavior with my Hexacopter Y6\r\n- All further tests were done (with the exact reproduced problem) inside simulation (Airsim HIL)\r\n- Both cases: Firmware 1.9.2, px4_fmu-v5_multicopter.px4 not working, and px4_fmu-v5_default.px4 1.8.2

I have a fleet of quads that have been flying extremely well for months now. I am using a Pixhawk Cube with a Here+ GPS. I updated one of these units to v1.9.0, and this is where I found this problem. I have also flashed v1.9.1 and v1.9.2 all with the same problems:\r\n\r\nTakeoff: when the vehicle lifts off it seems to do so very weakly, as opposed to taking off quickly. About 2 out of 3 times, the vehicle looses heading (leaving the ground) and corrects itself during ascent, or as it reaches the takeoff height.  The issue for me, is my quads often carry heavy flat payloads in high wind situations and I am afraid this may cause a crash.\r\n\r\nAttitude control: The vehicle is controlled via companion computer relaying to a ground station allowing easy keyboard controls. We had our craft slowed down to restrict jerky movement and to restrict yawing speeds (as I said heavy flat payloads). When I updated to v1.9.0 and up, the yawing became extremely fast (almost catastrophic). Also jerking the vehicle side to side was also very stable prior to updating, but with the newest update version, the drone almost flips itself when jerking side to side (without a payload).\r\n\r\nI have tried this on 4 different units all with the same issue.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to keep my vehicles up to date, but I have been sticking with v1.8.2 until the issues have been resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12480","id":468137380,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjk3NjI4NDQ3","number":12480,"title":"When setting pos_sp_triplet yaw, also set the yaw valid flag to true","user":{"login":"dusan19","id":35773661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzczNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35773661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19","html_url":"https://github.com/dusan19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusan19/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":78699954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODY5OTk1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Multirotor%20%F0%9F%9B%B8","name":"Multirotor 🛸","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2019-07-15T13:46:45Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T00:53:41Z","closed_at":"2019-10-08T00:53:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/12480","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12480","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12480.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12480.patch","merged_at":"2019-10-08T00:53:41Z"},"body":"I ran into a problem when executing a mission with following mission items:\r\n1. Set ROI location (different than the initial drone heading)\r\n2. Takeoff\r\n3. Waypoint\r\nThe following happens: The drone takes off at the takeoff location and hovers there indefinitely instead of going to the next waypoint (mission item 3).\r\nI observed this using the simulation with a multicopter.\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging I found out that this is the what leads to this behavior:\r\n1.

Work item is completed, drone took off, and the actual takeoff nav_cmd type is being processed. In set_mission_item() current nav_cmd is changed from takeoff to waypoint, since the drone took off already, at the same step mission item yaw is set to NAN. Furthermore, set_mission_item() calls mission_item_to_position_setpoint() which sets the triplet yaw valid flag to false since yaw is set to NAN.\r\n4. The drone reaches the takeoff position as nav_cmd is set to waypoint, but the yaw is not reached. mission::on_active() calls heading_sp_update() which sets the mission item yaw to face the ROI location and sets the pos_sp_triplet yaw to the same value. This should ensure that the drone yaws towards the ROI, but the yaw_valid flag is false so this doesnt happen and the yaw setpoint is never reached, which means that the mission item is never reached.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nProposed solution is just setting the yaw_valid flag to true when heading_sp_update() updates the heading.

I updated the latest px4 firmware 1.9.2 through QGC. The pixhawk is fmu-v2, I use a companion compute board insatlled ros kinetic and mavros. And I'm trying to do offboard control indoor with vicon device.\r\n2. As the  screenshot shows, I publish the vicon data to the mavros/vision_pose/pose topic, and the left window shows the data with commander line: rostopic echo mavros/vision_pose/pose, the middle window shows the data with commander line: rostopic echo mavros/local_position/pose, and the right window is the QGC analyzer, and the three sets of position data is consistent. So I think I set the EKF2 parameters in QGC right based on this \r\n3. After I keep publishing data through the topic mavros/vision_pose/pose and run the script which continues to publish the waypoint to the topic /mavros/setpoint_position/local, I can change the drone to the offboard mode by using QGC,  when the drone is in offboard mode, it just takes off and seems not be able to reach the fixed point and hover, which should be the position (0,0,0.5) as I set in my code,  it just drifted away in one direction, and seems to rise up constantly. I also tried the code here, https://github.com/mzahana/px4_indoor_navigation/blob/master/scripts/px4_offbaord_test.py\r\nand it has the same results and can not hold position. I tuned the yaw rate controller PID, roll and pitch controller PID and they are fine. But I don't know whether this is a firmware issue or I need to tune the position controller PID.

problem solved by the proposed feature**\r\nIt is sometimes desired to lock all outputs to the disarmed values when disarmed. This is not possible when the safety switch is disabled (by setting CBRK_IO_SAFETY). In this case, the system is either in prearmed or in armed mode, and the servos are always free to move.\r\n\r\n**Describe your preferred solution**\r\nAdd an option to lock all outputs to the disarmed values when in prearmed mode. This could be a parameter named CBRK_IO_PREARMED:\r\n- `CBRK_IO_PREARMED = 0`: current behaviour\r\n- `CBRK_IO_PREARMED = 42`: all outputs locked to disarmed values when disarmed or prearmed.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n- force disarmed values when CBRK_IO_SAFETY is set and the system is not armed. This would be an easier solution, but might break someone's workflow.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe current behaviour is based on the assumption that (i) rotor commands are scaled with thrust command, like it is the case for multirotors, and (ii) flap motion is harmless.\r\nHowever this is not always true:\r\n- a rotor can be mixed to roll only. It is thus not stopped by a low thrust value, and starts spinning unexpectedly. This can be dangerous.\r\n- servos may drive heavy/large parts, which are better locked when disarmed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12457/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12448","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12448/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12448/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12448/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12448","id":465964179,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjk1OTAyMzMy","number":12448,"title":"Fix vehicle flight time","user":{"login":"bkueng","id":281593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/281593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng","html_url":"https://github.com/bkueng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkueng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-07-09T20:12:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T00:27:02Z","closed_at":"2019-07-10T00:26:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/12448","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12448","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12448.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12448.patch","merged_at":"2019-07-10T00:26:41Z"},"body":"`_param_total_flight_time_low.get()` is an int32_t and gets sign-extended if cast directly to uint64_t.

This allows to check if the sensor orientation is set correctly and the magnetometers mounts are not completely misaligned. It should result in less false positives because of small magnetometer amplitude differences between internal and external compass since we had a lot of false positives preventing people to fly with perfectly fine setups.\r\n\r\nThere's also some refactoring going on:\r\n- There were early returns one of which lead to not unsubscribing from the sensors topic and leaking file descriptors.\r\n- matrix namespace can be used globally in the cpp source to safe repetitive code\r\n- we should shift towards consistent camelCase function names in our C++ classes, that improves readability against variables\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\n~Not yet tested. Tests to come.~\r\n**EDIT:** I did bench tests and it works great 🎉 :\r\n- I strapped a GPS module (with external mag) to a pixhawk 4 with foam in between to avoid mag interference because of the pxihawk 4 metal case.\r\n- I did the compass calibration.\r\n- I armed with all the circuit breakers because it's only a board. It worked every time with this fixed setup.\r\n- I took the GPS module and external compass off and tilted it a bit. From 30° (default) on in any direction it denies to arm and shows you what the inconsistency error in degree is such that the user gets a feel if it's 180° or 31°.\r\n  <img width=\"281\" alt=\"QGC1\"

It works fine before the PX4 version 1.7. However, since version 1.9.0, I am not able to obtain the correct mavlink_hil_actuator_controls_t message (all zeros after being armed) to control my vehicle unless I send mavlink_hil_state_quaternion_t. Before version 1.8.0, the mavlink_hil_state_quaternion_t message is not necessary for the HIL Simulation.\n\nIn version 1.9.0, I can send mavlink_hil_state_quaternion_t message to obtain motor control signals, but it will cause \"No local position\" error in Position Mode due to the above bug. \n\nI delete the code \n\"orb_publish(ORB_ID(sensor_accel), _accel_pub, &accel);\"\nthen, it will work properly.\n\nThere is one more problem, why mavlink_hil_state_quaternion_t is required in 1.9.0 compared with the previous versions. I think mavlink_hil_gps_t and mavlink_hil_sensor_t should be enough, because most information of mavlink_hil_state_quaternion_t has been included in the previous two message.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12249/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12247","id":454880681,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTQ4ODA2ODE=","number":12247,"title":"EKF2

bug**\r\n\r\nSince Firmware Commit https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/43e3fc707de823faa19b16091e5ee4a900e3c446 the typhoon_h480 model does not exhibit good position control in gazebo simulation with mavros. Still the case as at https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/b0176dc88aecd22363f771bfe62dafa57a6a194a. The error message ```Critical navigation failure! Check sensor calibration``` is logged in conjunction with the problem.\r\n\r\nFrom release v1.9.0 to the commit prior to the reported issue (4a4d323) seem to work fine.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Load commit version and ensure a totally clean build/initialisation (problem may not manifest unless all these steps are followed):\r\n```\r\ncd <FIRMWARE LOCATION>\r\ngit checkout <COMMIT UNDER TEST>\r\nmake clean\r\ngit submodule update\r\nrm ~/.ros/eeprom/parameters\r\nmake px4_sitl_default gazebo_typhoon_h480\r\n```\r\n2. roslaunch model ```roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch vehicle:=typhoon_h480```\r\n3. Arm / transition to offboard mode\r\n4. Send position target\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nStable position control behaviour (from commit 4a4d323):\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=6c788665-95f7-4b2b-a963-9ad58911024c\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nUnstable position control behaviour:\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=894c8553-18b1-4fc1-ad4a-d1587485637e\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- Iris model still seems to work OK in this regard\r\n- Have also observed ```Preflight Fail: Compass #0 uncalibrated``` but possibly due to not clearing parameter files between different build levels.\r\n- when using ```commander takeoff``` in gazebo via the pxh> shell the vehicle seems stable.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12216","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12216/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12216/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12216/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12216","id":453790360,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTM3OTAzNjA=","number":12216,"title":"NuttX

over USB fails when the flight controller is on battery power if there's no receiver running on the PC side during the first 1-2 seconds after the connection.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n~~1. Make sure no MAVLink receivers (QGroundControl, MAVROS, etc) are running on your PC\r\n2. Connect your flight controller to a PC via USB\r\n3. Wait for the flight controller to boot (let it pass bootloader + wait for 1-2 sec)\r\n4. Try to connect to the flight controller via MAVLink (using QGroundControl/MAVROS/mavlink_shell script).~~ **Turns out this was a bug in Ubuntu 16.04**\r\n\r\nAlternatively,\r\n1. Provide power to your flight controller through its power port\r\n2. Wait for the flight controller to boot + 1-2 sec\r\n3. Connect the flight controller to a PC via USB\r\n4. Try to connect to the flight controller via MAVLink\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nMAVLink connection should be established (QGroundControl should display current FCU status, MAVROS should report heartbeats, mavlink_shell should display `nsh >` prompt)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nThe underlying serial device (`/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux) appears in the system, but MAVLink connection is not established (QGroundControl suggests rebooting the vehicle, mavlink_shell doesn't go anywhere past `Connecting to MAVLINK...` message)\r\n\r\nI've noticed this behavior on a Pixracer.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n~~This issue was present in v1.8.2, but was harder to notice. In v1.8.2, the \"timeout\" started after I've connected the USB cable to the PC, not straight after FCU boot. Apparently this was enough to let our companion computer finish booting and start MAVROS.~~ **This was a bug in Ubuntu 16.04 and is not related to this issue**\r\n`mavlink` process doesn't seem to report any problems in the debug console - in fact, `mavlink status` shows an instance running over `/dev/ttyACM0` on the PX4 side. USB status is shown correctly in the `system_power` message (running `listener system_power` shows a message with `usb_connected: 1` and `usb_valid: 1` when the cable is plugged and `usb_connected: 0` and `usb_valid: 0` when it isn't).\r\n\r\nThis is a showstopper for us, since we're using USB for our companion computer connection.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12196","id":452784739,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg1NjA2MTU1","number":12196,"title":"land_detector

the bug**\nThe issue extensively described in\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/12001#issuecomment-492639819\nand point 5. of https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/12014#issue-278399940\nis still existent on VTOLs (also in the release 1.9).\n\n**To Reproduce**\nReproducable in SITL with the Deltawing\n1. Start simulation with joystick configured\n2. When GPS is locked but it's still in Manual mode from bootup hold throttle stick high and switch to position mode.\n3. Let go of the stick and let it center\n4. Arm and the vehicle goes up without smooth takeoff and possibly detects landing even though it should idle\n\n**Expected behavior**\nPoint 4. above.\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\n- problem found on a real VTOL with pixhawk 4 and almost unchanged 1.9 stable flashed\n\n**Additional context**\nhttps://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/1c776f16ec8321245e4fa8afd6ffd5003a3ef0bb fixes this problem for multicopters and I did extensive testing on multicopter platforms but didn't know that VTOL seems to work differently and apparently doesn't go though this part of the code.\n\nFYI @RomanBapst
