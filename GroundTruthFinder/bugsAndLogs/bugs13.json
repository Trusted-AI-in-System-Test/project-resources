The last attitude setpoint from before sending atttitude setpoints is kept instead.\n\nThis problem persists even with @irsdkv's fix #13141, even though now a few of the setpoints are registered : \n![bokeh!UNITO-UNDERSCORE!plot(7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48206725/66927391-0422d980-f030-11e9-8f88-6df6be4b9e81.png)\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Switch to branch of PR #13141 (optional, but recommended)\n1. Start HIL simulation with the standard VTOL model (Gazebo)\n1. Launch MAVSDK offboard example.\n1. Observe the problem\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe vehicle should follow the offboard setpoints, like in this log where the MAVSDK offboard example works with Iris quadcopter in HIL: \nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=f032c92d-ffa3-4831-a730-977bbb8e229e\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nStandard VTOL, HIL:\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=1fae08b3-82f3-4a45-b5d9-ff997bb9e7a3\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\n\n* HIL Standard VTOL QuadPlane, sys_autostart = 1002\n* Pixhawk 4 is the used hardware\n\n**Additional context**\n#13141 fixes the problem for SITL, but interestingly enough not for HIL. Without #13141, it makes sense that it's not working, whereas with it I really don't know why the old setpoint persists.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13206","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13206/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13206/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13206/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13206","id":507798188,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzI4NzE2MDc4","number":13206,"title":"Fix

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nApparently hot fixing the takeoff with #12250 had the side effect #13167:\r\n~VTOL flaps are not moving according to attitude control before arming in multicopter state.~\r\nVTOL flaps of a tailsitter are moving trying to reach north heading.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nSince for the takeoff fix it's only necessary to reset the body thrust I'm removing removing the reset for the attitude setpoint quaternion.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nThe real solution is to have a clear strategy to always publish an attitude setpoint AND to handle no valid attitude setpoint properly in the attitude controller. This is again a hotfix.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\n- [x] Check takeoff is still smooth for VTOL in gazebo (doesn't break original issue #12171)\r\n- [x] Check flaps are moving in the described case on the real vehicle (fixes #13167)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFirst proposal by @xdwgood to solve this: #13178.

above.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13197","id":507277453,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzI4Mjk3NDUw","number":13197,"title":"run

The roll and pitch setpoints are set to zero and continues to fly to the last direction where offboard mode was triggered. The offboard position setpoints fly as expected without the loiter type mask.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-10-14 12-05-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5248102/66743792-fe37c780-ee7a-11e9-8d67-0b0f06dd44d1.png)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Take off FW vehicle in SITL\r\n2. Send `SET_POSITION_LOCAL_NED` setpoint with `type_mask=0x3000` ([see](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_receiver.cpp#L774)\r\n3. Swich mode to offboard mode\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe FW vehicle circles around the loiter setpoint\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nThe [log](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=8617fe45-3269-4098-9165-e94b176d74a4) shows the offboard setpoint resulting in a fly away. A local position setpoint of [0.0, 0.0, 20.0] was being streemed with`type_mask=0x3000`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCurrently flying offboard position setpoints are passed as a reference position for the L1 controller, which results the vehicle turning around and traversing the setpoint as can be seen [here](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=209a8f30-a2aa-45f1-85b0-6755170b88a2).

problem solved by the proposed pull request**\r\nUnder certain circumstances, when running the `listener` command with the `-n` argument, it would incorrectly timeout. For example, by using `uorb top`, I can see that the `telemetry_status` message is being published once per second. However, when running `listener telemetry_status -n 100`, I receive two messages, then the message `Waited for 2 seconds without a message. Giving up.`\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI ran a series of `listener` commands on different topics, with every possible combination of the `-i`, `-r`, and `-n` parameters.\r\n\r\n**Describe your preferred solution**\r\nI suspect that the issue had something to do with the `listener` performing a busy-wait between messages, therefore using up all available CPU. This can be demonstrated by running `listener cpuload -n 10` and observing that the load on every message except for the first is 100%. So, I changed the `listener` to poll on messages asynchronously. This fixed the issue with `telemetry_status`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSome work has been done recently on the listener, in #12799 and #13006 .\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13148","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13148/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13148/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13148/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13148","id":504830499,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDQ4MzA0OTk=","number":13148,"title":"QGC _altitude issues_CUAV Nano","user":{"login":"Tony3dr","id":39415493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDE1NDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39415493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr","html_url":"https://github.com/Tony3dr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tony3dr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MaEtUgR","id":4668506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4668506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR","html_url":"https://github.com/MaEtUgR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaEtUgR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2019-10-09T18:53:01Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T16:17:47Z","closed_at":"2020-03-12T04:34:55Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nWe have noticed the altitude issues on the CUAV Nano this issue was noted on QGC altitude reading.

the bug**\r\nChanging the initial rotation (yaw) of the copter `iris_vision` in Gazebo SITL causes the vision position estimation to fail. With different initial yaw like the default in `iris_vision.world` it works, albeit very shaky.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nModify `iris_vision.world` by rotating the model:\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n<include>\r\n      <uri>model://iris_vision</uri>\r\n      <!-- Original: <pose>1.01 0.98 0.83 0 0 1.14</pose> -->\r\n      <pose>1.01 0.98 0.83 0 0 -1.5</pose>\r\n</include>\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\nRun `make px4_sitl gazebo_iris_vision`, switch to position mode and take off, hover a few meters above ground. After a few seconds the copter flys away full speed, and then the failsafe kicks in and switches it to Altitude mode.\r\nConsole output:\r\n```\r\nINFO  [ecl/EKF] EKF aligned, (pressure height, IMU buf: 14, OBS buf: 9)\r\nINFO  [ecl/EKF] 1432000: EKF commencing external vision position fusion\r\nINFO  [ecl/EKF] 1432000: EKF commencing external vision yaw fusion\r\nINFO  [commander] Takeoff detected\r\nWARN  [commander] Failsafe enabled: no local position\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNot sure, honestly :) Even with the default initial yaw of the model the copter is very unstable so maybe the noise/drift parameters of the Gazebo vision plugin are just too extreme? I don't know. However, I would at least expect the behavior to be independent of the initial yaw of the copter, that is, it should either always work or always fail (after some time maybe).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13110","id":503403890,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzI1MjYyOTEy","number":13110,"title":"uorb_rtps_message_ids.yaml:

STORAGE_INFORMATION, that need to be asked by the ground).\r\nduring checking my message, I tested what will happen if I remove the SD card during operation. doing that caused the mavlink thread to stop.\r\n\r\nfirst, do you consider that as a problem? how the system behave if SD is removed, or get malfunction during flight.\r\nI only checked that above scenario, (added periodic check mavlink message). but i guess that other methods that required the SD are much more critical, for example reading mission on commander....\r\n\r\nI think that it related to the fact that reading the status of

affected.\n\n\n**Additional context**\nNoticed it only because of accidentally triggered front transition, while also giving some roll input before. Then the rate_sp froze for 1s at a large value, almost resulting in a flip of the VTOL.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/65669305-9a706a80-e043-11e9-882a-93d21eba2ddf.png)\n\n@dagar @RomanBapst

the bug**\r\nFW throttle goes briefly to 0 after front transition is completed (see screenshot below).\r\n\r\nThe reason for this bug probably is that vtol_attitude controller listens to the throttle setpoint from the attitude controller before this one is initialized to the correct value after the transition (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/41516fbd5532cdb5c8beb2e519ca4d8e5247a579/src/modules/vtol_att_control/standard.cpp#L460). \r\nvtol_att begins to set throttle equal to whatever fw_att_controller publishes after _vtol_schedule.flight_mode is set to FW_MODE, which is done in update_vtol_state(). \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nDo a transition in SITL, look at the logs (see below).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nthrottle should go from transition throttle to user commanded (stabilized mode) or to throttle output from TECS. \r\n\r\n**Log Files and

crazyflie # CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE is not set is replaced by CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE=y. This should be done using menuconfig:\r\n> \r\n>   make bitcraze_crazyflie_default menuconfig\r\n> or qconfig (Check Low-level console support under Serial Driver Support in GUI):\r\n> \r\n>   make bitcraze_crazyflie_default qconfig\r\n\r\nEverything worked fine and \"make bitcraze_crazyflie_default upload\" was successful initially. But QGC couldn't connected to the crazyflie. The message showed by QGC was \"vehicle not responding\". So I followed the above guidance by _Check Low-level console support under Serial Driver Support in GUI_. Save this config and \"make bitcraze_crazyflie_default upload\" again, I received the following error message:\r\n\r\n> pan@pan-VB:~/src/Firmware$ make bitcraze_crazyflie_default upload\r\n> -- PX4

form.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12986/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12985","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12985/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12985/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12985/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12985","id":495272900,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzE4ODUxMTIx","number":12985,"title":"mavlink

quick work around for https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/12957.\r\n\r\nThis pull request rearranges the mavlink helpers slightly to shift the the buffer, should_transmit, error count updates into the single final mavlink `mavlink_end_uart_send` call rather than each `mavlink_send_uart_bytes` (called 3 times per mavlink message send).\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by unifying some of the uart/udp logic differences. Each write (`mavlink_send_uart_bytes`) goes into a buffer, then that buffer is written out once (`mavlink_end_uart_send`). This should prevent broken mavlink messages from going out over the wire, and will also be slightly more efficient by minimizing work for each send.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n - [ ] move the get_free_tx_buf() check to mavlink_start_uart_send, store the result and skip mavlink_send_uart_bytes if there's not enough buffer space

the bug**\r\nUsers tend to use MAVLink over all sorts of links with all sorts of implementations. While integrating a certain method of forwarding messages I realized that the `_mav_finalize_message_chan_send` function that gets automatically called when sending any telemetry or acks sends the message internally with three write operations on the UART device to save RAM by not copying the <256 byte payload to a buffer. So it sends\r\n- header\r\n- payload\r\n- checksum\r\n- (signature)\r\n\r\nwith independent writes and @dagar pointed out in the dev call it actually checks if the outgoing buffer has enough space for each write independently which means it could easily be that just the header gets sent and the rest is skipped when the link is congested.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to forward the outgoing traffic to something else than the UART, interleaving it with a different protocol's packets or wrapping it in a custom layer it's strictly not possible to grab the per-message output of the PX4 MAVLink stream without clobbering the autogenerated MAVLink c_library or the sending routine of every single message. I'm also assuming that depending on the OS/RTOS sending/receiving UART bursts of fragmented message part is not the most efficient way to handle DMA and interrupts.\r\n\r\n**Code references**\r\nExample of how sending a message is typically triggered in PX4: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/d4f984fea5079b4a2a7ec086df8cdb8c47583027/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_messages.cpp#L370-L371\r\nThe helper this \"convenience function\" calls:\r\nhttps://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v2/blob/ac40c0329e88b70ae5db4c1467ed5853d305af54/common/mavlink_msg_heartbeat.h#L198\r\nThe 3 or more write calls the helper function initiates:\r\nhttps://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v2/blob/ac40c0329e88b70ae5db4c1467ed5853d305af54/mavlink_helpers.h#L353-L355\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIMHO a MAVLink message should be sent by first checking if the link buffer still has the capacity, if yes filling a send buffer with the complete message and then issue one write with that send buffer.\r\n\r\nSomething like how the MAVSDK is doing it but optimized to work with fewer resources: https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/blob/14056858a03432d9177f7039581e1fc7faf5e21c/src/core/udp_connection.cpp#L155-L160\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- This was discussed in the dev call of 11.09.2019\r\n- My minimalistic possibly imperfect way of hot fixing the issue made available to the original repo for further discussion: https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink/pull/353\r\n- @dagar's dangling pr to solve a part of the problem: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/10394\r\nwith essential line https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/10394/files#diff-b168380964a16cd9b42995acc531f1e5R110\r\n\r\nFYI @dagar @nicovanduijn @julianoes @jkflying

As soon as the GPS checks pass and the global position is valid, the drone starts to move to in some direction (previous origin?). This is truly commanded and is most likely an issue in `FlightTaskAuto`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Do an auto takeoff with flow only (without ever having global frame initialized)\r\n2. Start GPS in air\r\n3. When the global position gets valid, the drone will start to fly towards some direction\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nStay at the same location, shift properly the origin of the local frame and the memorized positions.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nI don't have a log file to share right now, will try to upload one soon.\r\nBelow is a screenshot showing \r\n![2019-09-06_17-32-00_01_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822839/64441394-196e2500-d0ce-11e9-9ddb-4c92ee3fc10f.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12911","id":489922466,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODk5MjI0NjY=","number":12911,"title":"Px4 Flow Sensor - Unable to properly work","user":{"login":"Ken-Thorburn","id":53093134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDkzMTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53093134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn","html_url":"https://github.com/Ken-Thorburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ken-Thorburn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":706040782,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDYwNDA3ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/vision","name":"vision","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":"Vision based flight"},{"id":1589020676,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTg5MDIwNjc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2019-09-05T18:16:12Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T13:21:08Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T13:21:08Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I am trying to use a px4 flow sensor for position hold mode on a drone.

request fixing part of [#12758](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/12758)\n\n**Describe problem solved by the proposed pull request**\nFixed bank loiter after a No Global Position Failsafe wasn't working for VTOLs in FW mode. \n\n**Test data / coverage**\nTested in SITL `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol` by stopping `gpssim` driver. I also reactivated the `gpssim` driver to see if the vehicle recovers its position and continues its mission afterwards.\n\nLogs:\nWorking fixed bank loiter, late recovery:\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=217b432a-9452-4f67-862d-32322aaefe96\n\nWorking recovery:\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=b165d3ea-54cc-4145-aeb7-acf75892611e\n(running on an older commit head, but meanwhile it doesn't work anymore on this one, see this log: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=2aad8195-476f-4af6-b289-c214e61fe853)\n\nGPSF is still working on normal planes : \nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=79b5e483-f698-4aa0-8b30-265d25a3cd14\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nPublishing the failsafe values to `fw_virtual_attitude_setpoint` topic if the vehicle is a VTOL so that `VtolType::update_fw_state()` doesn't overwrite them with old values anymore.\n\n**Describe possible alternatives**\n\n**Additional context**\nThis PR does not fix the GPS recovery & continuing the automatic flight problems. \nAlso, the landing after \"Terminate\" is not working, the drone keeps loitering in fixed bank angle mode\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12778/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12774","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12774/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12774/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12774/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12774","id":483894893,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODM4OTQ4OTM=","number":12774,"title":"Gazebo

the bug**\nThe following points don't work as they should upon triggering a GPS Failsafe on a VTOL drone in FW (flying in an AUTO mode):\n1) The drone doesn't do the fixed bank loiter upon a GPS Failsafe. Instead, it pretty much continues to fly in whatever pose it happened to be upon triggering. \n2) Also, the landing doesn't seem to work. In SITL it just keeps flying.\n3) Recovering the GPS signal doesn't work properly.\n4) It \"randomly\" falls back to the previous flight mode after some time (after it should have initiated landing)\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Start SITL with `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol`\n1. Set the NAV_GPSF_* parameters to some non-zero value\n1. Launch a mission or just loiter in FW\n1. Trigger the failsafe by disabling the GPS signal: `gpssim stop`\n1. The drone will not be doing the fixed bank loiter properly\n1. Enable the GPS driver again: `gpssim start`\n1. The drone will not (directly) recover its global position even though on QGC you can see its exact position\n1. Wait\n1. The drone will not initiate landing (even though navigator says Terminate)\n1. At some point the drone will switch back to what it was doing before (Mission or Loiter)\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe drone should do the fixed bank loiter as a FW plane and upon recovery of its global position continue its mission or whatever it was doing before.\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\nSITL, v1.9 : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5befa577-0ade-4c90-b82c-045830915138\nSITL, current master : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=ac15492a-04b5-4e27-851e-cdb00cb27d62\n\nReal flight, v1.9 : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7c1a4be9-8e6b-41e2-b7fa-dd29cd270795\n\n* our pilot took over after 7s, but clearly the fixed bank angle didn't work.\n![bokeh!UNITO-UNDERSCORE!plot(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48206725/63368099-7d2de980-c37d-11e9-8b3b-44fddc5429c9.png)\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\n\n* SITL : standard VTOL quadplane\n* Real drone : standard VTOL, running v1.9 on a Cube\n\n**Additional context**\nI tested the Failsafe on the Gazebo plane and it works as it should.

the bug**\nDuring the take off ramp, the vehicle doesn't respect the MPC_TKO_SPEED constraint. Instead, the vehicle accelerates to MPC_Z_VEL_MAX_UP even when below MPC_LAND_ALT1 (and after finishing the ramp it slows down again if still below MPC_LAND_ALT1).\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Start SITL (tested with Gazebo's standard VTOL plane, but I imagine it's the same for any MC)\n1. Set up parameters (tested with MPC_TKO_SPEED =1m/s, MPC_Z_VEL_MAX_UP = 2.5m/s, MPC_TKO_RAMP_T = 5s, MPC_LAND_ALT1 = 10m in SITL, and with MPC_TKO_SPEED =1.5m/s, MPC_Z_VEL_MAX_UP = 2.5m/s, MPC_TKO_RAMP_T = 5s, MPC_LAND_ALT1 = 12m in the real world)\n1. Take off\n\nI experienced this behaviour with the take off command in QGC as well as launching missions. It's reproducible in SITL and on our real VTOL drone.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nHave the vehicle respect the MPC_TKO_SPEED during the take off ramp\n\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\n_Always_ provide a link to the flight log file:\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=a9e878be-395a-45ee-8f72-40db4b265931\n\nAdd screenshots to help explain your problem.\n![Screenshot from 2019-08-13 10-45-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48206725/62927814-9a7c1a00-bdb7-11e9-9d7d-ab972713cbd2.png)\n\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\n\n* Tested on standard VTOL in Gazebo and a v-tail quadplane in the real world\n* SITL was tested on both on v1.9.0 and current (13.08.19) master, real drone runs v1.9.0 on a Cube\n\nOn a side note: why does QGC complain about MPC_TKO_RAMP_T having to be between 0 and 1 and in the parameter reference it says between 0 and 5?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},
