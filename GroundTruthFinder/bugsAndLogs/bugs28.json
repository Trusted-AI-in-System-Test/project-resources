In general case we may have multiple telemetry links (for redundancy) and at least on one working link should be enough.\n\nI have some ideas:\n- Add channel ID to `telemetry status` topic and track status for each link independently, but this will require some more code (storing timestamps for each link) and not beautiful from uORB point of view.\n- Add multiple `telemetry status` topics (up to 4 or 7?), one for each mavlink channel, as for e.g. `actuator_conrols_X`. This is more clean solution but will require much more subscriptions/publications, that are expensive.\n- When publishing telemetry status from mavlink check previous heartbeat timestamp and don't overwrite if new value is less. Hacky and ugly, but simple way to workaround the bug.\n\nAlso it would be good to have feedback check, i.e. on autopilot side check timestamp of last heartbeat received by GS, to make sure that link works in two-ways.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/1124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/1124/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/1105","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/1105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/1105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/1105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/1105","id":36875432,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjg3NTQzMg==","number":1105,"title":"Remove

Any variable (especially those which are used for inter-app communication) should adhere to this standard.\n\nIn the current master branch the field `pitch` of [manual_control_setpoint_s](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/uORB/topics/manual_control_setpoint.h) is inverted.\n\nIt seems that the change was introduced with commit 1d5f62d890d1d85cef5e0f8e282d8e9e70717d46 [starting from here.](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/1d5f62d890d1d85cef5e0f8e282d8e9e70717d46#diff-b2cdb687c37812923ec65dc8fc767506L1400)\n\nBefore the commit the pitch value was mapped from the RC value with:\n\n```\n/*\n* pitch input - stick down is negative, but stick down is pitching up (pos) in NED,\n * so reverse sign.\n*/\nmanual_control.pitch = limit_minus_one_to_one(-1.0f * _rc.chan[_rc.function[PITCH]].scaled);\n```\n\nafterwards/now it is mapped with\n\n```\nmanual_control.pitch = get_rc_value(PITCH, -1.0, 1.0);\n```\n\nso the previous correct sign change got lost.\n\nBecause the current state is confusing and wrong we have to either _rename_ the name of the variables in manual_control_setpoint_s or we have to _revert the sign change_. I am in favor of reverting the sign change.\n\nI found the following commits related to the above change (directly after 1d5f62d890d1d85cef5e0f8e282d8e9e70717d46 in the commit history):
