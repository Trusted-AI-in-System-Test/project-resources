I'm not sure yet what the correlation is to connecting to QGC.\n# Issue 2:\n\nThe next issue is that magnetometer calibrations don't stay. After calibration, the system goes to standby, but on reboot, it again fails to start up properly.\nNote that there is not proper error message related to a missing calibration or similar, just that ARMING_STATE_INIT to ARMING_STATE_STANDBY is denied if I try to arm it.\n\nNote : I have main board orientation set to YAW_270 and external mag orientation set to default (YAW_NONE)\n\n@pavel-kirienko @LorenzMeier Help would be appreciated on this one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3117","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3117/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3117/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3117/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/3117","id":114662588,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTQ2NjI1ODg=","number":3117,"title":"Random

we have done some hover tests where we wanted to tune mc_pos_control for altitude and position. We flew with master 0fed23a and we chery-picked EKF fix https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/2968. \nThe fix itself works as before it, our LPOS_Z was totally different then baro signal, and it was causing way too much CPU load. Now the load dropped down to ~25% for us, and EKF performance is much better, but still not as good as before pulling the https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/2815#event-413847903. \n\nNote: We had quite bad GPS signal yesterday, but it was pretty much the same for all the tests. \nThe main issues are sudden jumps/spikes in the position setpoint, and the fact that position setpoint rises although throttle stick is in or below the deadzone - basically we had a situation that aircraft was rising a couple of meters up while throttle stick was at zero (http://logs.uaventure.com/view/ekETmDV6hEsFNhENV7CAkA! - unfortunately logmuncher does not display rc inputs - I think we have some naming mismatch), ergo estimator does not work properly.\n\nBelow are two snaps showing the spikes and lpos not fully following baro:\n![alt_ekffix](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13371589/10507692/89514978-7322-11e5-8b5d-60bdb8125b96.png)\n![baro_ekffix](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13371589/10507691/89510fd0-7322-11e5-8987-2c9ca0159dd6.png)\n(http://logs.uaventure.com/view/WPiHd9TEXGvyGoSjZgidkh)\n\nThen we switched to the branch with old version of EKF and its performance was far more reliable (pilot finally had control in altitude control), although not fully perfect due to bad gps signal. But the difference has been significant. \n(http://logs.uaventure.com/view/gNoRJNsCHftMQ6pAJcFgn7)\n![alt_oldekf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13371589/10508342/c2afbc5a-7326-11e5-9ec2-d934b814dffa.png)\n![baro_oldekf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13371589/10508343/c2b10880-7326-11e5-90c5-08e0e8fbcc3d.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2977","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2977/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2977/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2977/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2977","id":110958073,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTA5NTgwNzM=","number":2977,"title":"Sensor-level HIL doesn't work anymore with X-Plane and master","user":{"login":"AndreasAntener","id":5750020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTAwMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5750020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreasAntener","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreasAntener/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-12T11:45:51Z","updated_at":"2015-10-21T15:54:39Z","closed_at":"2015-10-21T15:54:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"If I have sensor-level HIL enabled the HUD values \"twitch\" heavily when the plane sits still.

UAVCAN does support time synchronization over the CAN bus, and so does libuavcan ([spec](http://uavcan.org/Specification/6._Application_level_functions/#time-synchronization), [tutorial](http://uavcan.org/Implementations/Libuavcan/Tutorials/6._Time_synchronization)). The PR https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/2895 has extended the UAVCAN driver with time synchronization feature, at the same time breaking UAVCAN sensors (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/2912, https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/2911).\n## The problem\n\nObviously, in order for the sensor fusion to function correctly, all sensor measurements must be timestamped using the same (or synchronized) time source. This condition used to be easy to meet, since all sensor drivers were simply using HRT. This changed when a time synchronization master was added to the UAVCAN driver, because the library now uses a dedicated hardware timer (namely TIM5), which runs with a phase offset of about a second (didn't measure it exactly) with respect to the HRT, and incoming UAVCAN messages are timestamped by the library incorrectly using this time source. These incorrect timestamps are then copied further to ORB sensor topics.\n\nA temporary solution has been introduced (see https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/2914), in which the UAVCAN driver simply uses HRT instead of the library's provided timestamps, which is NOT a proper solution and provides degraded timestamping precision.\n## Solutions\n#### Use HRT instead of TIM5 for libuavcan\n\nThis is the easy way, but it has a significant drawback: _since HRT must be be monotonic, it cannot be synchronized with other time sources_, because that would require it to change rate and/or jump.\n\nDo we care about use cases where PX4 has to synchronize its time with an external time source, e.g. a companion computer or a GNSS receiver? I expect that we do.\n#### Use TIM5 for timestamping everywhere\n\nThis approach permits to maintain monotonicity of HRT, adding another clock which can change rate in order to maintain synchronization with an external source.\n\nThe current code will have to be updated in order to use the new, synchronized clock for timestamping instead of HRT. Also, the developers will have to keep in mind the difference between monotonic clock and synchronized clock, and why they are not interchangeable.\n\nFYI, grepping the codebase for `hrt_absolute_time` shows 464 matches.\n#### Extend HRT with synchronized clock\n\nFrom application-level standpoint this solution is identical to the previous one, the difference is in implementation - instead of using a dedicated hardware timer for synchronized clock, the HRT driver can be extended with notions of _phase offset_ and _rate offset_ between monotonic and synchronized clocks. By the way, this is how monotonic/synchronized clocks are implemented in STM32 and LPC11C24 drivers for libuavcan.

Yesterday we noticed that we don't get a current reading via MAVLink but it is logged correctly. To be more precise, the current reading we got over MAVLink was 0 or 1.\n\nIn https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/0e26c2b37b362c19d30f0544ed6d21bc408bcd7d/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_messages.cpp#L550 and https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/0e26c2b37b362c19d30f0544ed6d21bc408bcd7d/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_messages.cpp#L575 the battery current for MAVLink get's divided by 10. The target field is uint16. According to specs it's supposed to contain milliamps \\* 10. This suggests that the source field contains milliamps, but as far as I can tell it actually contains amps. This would match the effect we saw for currents between 0 and 15 amps.\n\nThe scaling for the MAVLink message changed during the last commit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2608","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2608/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2608/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2608/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2608","id":97402652,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NzQwMjY1Mg==","number":2608,"title":"Pitch SP handling in TECS","user":{"login":"LorenzMeier","id":1208119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier","html_url":"https://github.com/LorenzMeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzMeier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/2/labels","id":656066,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjU2MDY2","number":2,"title":"First beta release","description":"The first beta release is intended for early adopters and testers.

is what I found, correct me if I'm just wrong :):\n\nBasically, I think, in the current multi pubsub implementation, the publisher needs to be started before the subscriber, otherwise they won't talk to each other.\n\nAn example from #2297 would be:\n1. Mavlink starts first and wants to subscribe to the distance_sensor topic. It gets the first instance here:\n   https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/uORB/uORB.cpp#L144\n2. The the ll40ls wants to do a advertise_multi:\n   https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/drivers/ll40ls/LidarLitePWM.cpp#L116\n   https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/uORB/uORB.cpp#L93\n   I believe this fails here:\n   https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/uORB/uORBManager_nuttx.cpp#L246\n   And gets +1 here probably:\n   https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/uORB/uORBDevices_nuttx.cpp#L471\n3. This leads to mavlink subscribing on 0 and the ll40ls publishing on 1.\n\nInstead of the check ...\n- Does the node exist already?\n\nIt should be something like:\n- Does the node exist already and has stuff been published yet?\n- Does the node exist already but is it only opened by a subscriber?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2319/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2229","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2229/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2229/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2229/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/2229","id":80604126,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MDYwNDEyNg==","number":2229,"title":"pca8574
