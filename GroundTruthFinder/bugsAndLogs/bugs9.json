I\\O output, the phenomenon was same, ESC still detected no signal, servos frozen. \r\nThen I change the wires to FMU output, the ESC buzzing quickly, which indicate the throttle was too high, but in fact, the throttle stick of RC was at bottom.\r\n\r\nAfter I change the vehicle type to 'Bormatec Maja' , ESC and servos works fine, which means the ESC and servos works well.\r\nand 'Plane V-Tail'

the bug**\r\nWhen a mission is stopped midway, and the drone then lands, receives a new mission with all items having ``current=0`` parameters and is armed again, the drone immediately flies towards the waypoint from the old mission, instead of executing the first item on the new mission. This crashed our drone as it tilts and tries to fly forward before properly \"takeoff\" to a safe altitude, thus catching the ground with the landing struts.  \r\n\r\nThe resetting of ``mission_current`` seems to happen upon arming, but there seems to be some sort of race-condition, as the drone reports ``mission_current`` to reset to 0 upon arming, but the log shows the drone still gets a setpoint for the old waypoint and tries to fly that, before the ``mission_current`` index reset is realised.\r\n\r\nThomas Stauber spotted that our velocity controller asked for a 3m/s horizontal velocity immediately upon arming, which indicated that the drone was flying towards an old mission item.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7889925/82942796-d4aa5700-9f98-11ea-85f8-13f5744f75a6.png) \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps we did to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n1. Fly normal mission\r\n2. Before normal mission finishes, switch mode to \"land now\" or \"RTL\" and land the drone\r\n3. Start new flight with identical mission. (It uploads the same mission again, but doesn't clear the old one first)\r\n4. Arm and send \"start_mission\" command\r\n5. Drone attempts to fly to the waypoint it was at in the last mission and thus flip in the direction of that waypoint.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUpon uploading a new mission with no ``current=1`` parameters set, we would expect the drone to reset the current-index of mission items to 0. Intuitively I would expect the index to get reset when the PX4 accepts the new mission and sends ``MAV_MISSION_ACCEPTED`` and not first on arming the drone. \r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nflight log: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=116b78e1-7732-4e6e-acf8-88e640d8cdfc \r\nvideo of the takeoff and flip: https://nextcloud.sdu.dk/index.php/s/46H7m9TXgXkQqQF\r\n\r\nlog from our GCS rosbag, showing the ``mission_current`` is not reset until arming, but keeps the old missions current index. The new mission had been uploaded and accepted by the PX4 before this snippet from the log:\r\n```\r\n---\r\ndata: 0\r\n---\r\ndata: 0\r\n---            <----------- a second before it changes to 15, the flightmode of the FC is set to \"Auto - Mission\". It appears the current_waypoint change is due to the flightmode being changed\r\ndata: 15\r\n---\r\ndata: 15\r\n---\r\ndata: 15\r\n---\r\ndata: 15\r\n---\r\ndata: 15\r\n---            <----------- Right at the same time it goes from 15 to 0, is when the drone report it is \"armed\". So it seems like the index isn't reset until the drone is armed\r\ndata: 0\r\n---\r\ndata: 0\r\n---\r\ndata: 0\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Hexacopter using Pixhawk 2.1 Cube\r\n- (The long legs shown on the video are due to testing, we know they are long, ugly and doesn't help make it stable)\r\n- SD-card for PX4: Scandisk Edge 16GB - Class 4\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAs soon as we added ``current=1`` on the first item of the new mission we can no longer reproduce this error and we are using that fix for the time being.

the bug**\r\nThe \"loss of altitude\" quadchute only triggers when it's already too late. \r\n\r\nThe problem seems to lie with the non-documented hard-coded conditions on TECS height rate which take

Disable the elevator in the sdf file, e.g. by setting [the area of the elevator](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/blob/4acd679d17a735a1f62781349d14289a29b01014/models/standard_vtol/standard_vtol.sdf#L732) to 0 (you could also comment out the whole elevator block)\r\n2. `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol`\r\n3. Make sure VT_FW_ALT_ERR is set accordingly (in my logs 15m)\r\n4. Launch a mission (or something else) that makes the drone transition to FW\r\n5. In FW mode the drone will tip over and lose altitude\r\n6. Observe how late the the quadchute is triggered\r\n\r\nVersion 2: (not as extremely late, drone still crashed though after quadchute)\r\n1. Have the gazebo_standard_vtol model fly a normal mission with FW flight\r\n2. Make sure VT_FW_ALT_ERR is set accordingly (in my logs 15m)\r\n3. Disable the pusher motor (via motor failure plugin)\r\n4. Watch the drone lose altitude and eventually trigger the quadchute (still late, but not as late as with Version 1)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nQuadchute should activate as soon as you have lost VT_FW_ALT_ERR meters of altitude with respect to the altitude setpoint. I understand the idea behind also checking if the drone is falling to not trigger in situations where for example you ask for a steep climb that the drone can't immediately react to, but the current implementation clearly doesn't work well if it only triggers when the drone is falling out of the sky with more than 20m/s vertical speed with already more than 25m of altitude lost.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nVersion 1, disabled elevator: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=5e45b915-3e91-4156-9d14-956cbffbc73e\r\n\r\nVersion 2, disabled pusher motor: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=b3cf09c8-9b47-4832-98bf-b453ebd7cfa2\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Gazebo standard VTOL\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n(Part of) the reason why it triggers so late with Version 1 is that TECS first still needs to initialise after the front transition, but the drone is already dropping. It takes way too long until TECS actually asks for +1m/s height rate\r\n\r\n@sfuhrer @RomanBapst I think some thoughts should be spent on how to best set the trigger logic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14945","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14945/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14945/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14945/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14945","id":621758202,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjE3NTgyMDI=","number":14945,"title":"Mixer

I would have expected them to [ramp up](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#VT_B_TRANS_RAMP).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nIt's not completely trivial to reproduce and it's not always entirely equal.

Interestingly enough the back transition isn't the same when replacing the Takeoff waypoint with a VTOL takeoff waypoint.\r\n-Parameters: mostly default, need to set CBRK_VTOLARMING = 159753 to allow arming in FW mode.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n1. The MC motors should ramp up during the back transition, independent of the take off method used.\r\n2. (Even though it's a logical consequence of using FW L1 position control) IMO the drone shouldn't do this crazy U turn during transition. I'd be in favour of force-ending the transition when you are at the desired position even if the speed is too high.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nThe first two logs are both with a FW takeoff, identical setup but the direction of the U turn is different. The third log shows the mission where FW takeoff has been replaced with VTOL Takeoff. It's interesting to see that the MC motors ramp up in this case.\r\n\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=241b24bb-248a-4451-a7e0-4638565f9d34\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=abe58451-984d-43e9-a8ac-31308bf0d66e\r\n\r\nhttps://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=99aa4c67-3e82-47d8-95a3-105c49280e6f\r\n\r\n**Drone

Type \"ms5611 -T 5607 status\" to see correct output.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUsage screen should state to which commands which arguments apply.\r\n\r\n![Zrzut ekranu z 2020-05-08 09-37-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23101737/81382957-8596a200-910f-11ea-9e46-4f0d113e62de.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTested on master and 1.11.0 Beta 1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14860","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14860/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14860/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14860/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14860","id":614327433,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE0OTA2Mjg5","number":14860,"title":"[DO NOT MERGE] PX4Accelerometer/PX4Gyroscope discard duplicate consecutive samples","user":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/32","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestone/32","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/milestones/32/labels","id":4728829,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDcyODgyOQ==","number":32,"title":"Release v1.11.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"dagar","id":84712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":7,"closed_issues":167,"state":"open","created_at":"2019-10-07T16:06:51Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T12:29:40Z","due_on":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-05-07T20:35:51Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T00:14:53Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T00:14:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pulls/14860","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14860","diff_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14860.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14860.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"This is a quick workaround to catch any potentially misbehaving drivers.

up (in a different context) in https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/11785 but the more we look at it, the more this is a true issue and from a practical standpoint is making using autonomous takeoff not feasible given the high risk.\r\n\r\nLet me also preface this by saying a many things have been tested and changed and a makeshift solution was come up with as well but that doesn't solve the problem. Wheel Rate settings have been altered to various extreme and subdued amounts (as seen in the logs). This has reduced some things present like sudden full wheel deflection upon mission start but it never fixes the trajectory of the takeoff and that it does not generally point or aim to the takeoff waypoint but goes off course many time more than it does not.\r\n\r\nMultiple different aircraft and aircraft types were used, even though the mixer is the same, that is only because we have varying sizes and weights of test aircraft and even foam ones where the setup, weight and geometry on the nose gear and linkages is completely different (which is good to rule out a single hardware type or build as the culprit).\r\n\r\nI often have seen the wheel channel output (main 5) swing up and down 500us over neutral, essentially max on both extremes and even when that isnt having the same type of behavior exists at +/200. The scaling factor probably helps in these cases by reducing movement (so long as you are still on course enough or at least not going to crash on takeoff) but the thing to remember is this entire process is only 3-8 seconds long before you're airborne so it's easy to not see or overlook.\r\n\r\nThe hacked solution? Limit min/max pwm value of the wheel servo either in PX4 or at the servo level to limit how much steering can physically occur. This is not a solution but gets things airborne by quasi limiting the ability to go off course. Not a true solution.\r\n\r\nLogs:\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=efad594a-afe0-451a-a1dd-a6130e49a03b\r\nThis log has an sudden full right wheel right as the mission is initiated.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"815\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-06 at 4 09 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31726584/81230497-38072180-8fb7-11ea-9942-27b46c07db99.png\">\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=25ce0df8-15d6-4591-8578-83042921cffe - This is similar but not as severe as the previous log (still has huge wheel swings though).\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=53e17faa-3f52-4a3f-8e7e-b2d8c8ede219 - This log is interesting that the aircraft was purposely moved to the corner of the runway because the previous flights had it going to the right during the takeoff portion and it sill went much too hard right and then off the runway.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"825\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-06 at 4 35 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31726584/81230726-a1873000-8fb7-11ea-846f-1522b97372cc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=ee6bef2c-167c-4d43-ae96-8ac2144df2e1 - This takes off successfully because of the large area, thats the only reason.

Check QGC, EKF yaw estimate looks fine and matches EV.\r\n3. Stop sending EV data.\r\n4. Check QGC, EKF yaw estimate is spinning out of control.\r\n5. Start sending EV data again\r\n6. Check QGC, EKF yaw resets to correct EV value, but then continues spinning out of control.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n1. The yaw estimate falls back to compass after EV stop (?)\r\n2. The yaw estimate follows the external vision data after EV restart. \r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5557676/81130915-60d7da00-8f17-11ea-80ba-511c14d4fa75.png)\r\n\r\nLog from boot: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=c0a43438-fb28-45fd-9a5b-92329748fb93","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14838","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14838/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14838/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14838/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14838","id":612830725,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MTI4MzA3MjU=","number":14838,"title":"Misfire at catapult launch (custom FW version 1.7.2)","user":{"login":"MartinStokelj","id":30079270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDc5Mjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30079270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinStokelj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinStokelj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":78699916,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODY5OTkxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/Fixed%20Wing%20%F0%9F%9B%A9%EF%B8%8F","name":"Fixed Wing üõ©Ô∏è","color":"009800","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2020-05-05T19:11:20Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T12:02:16Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T12:02:16Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nFrom 55 test flights we had 2x misfire at catapult launch.

But I found the issue is independent of that pr.\r\n\r\nThe thrust doesn't ramp nicely anymore like it was designed but depending on stick input can go up and down unexpectedly during the ramp up. This can lead to early land detection if the thrust goes up high enough and then back down because the ramp is not yet high enough.\r\n\r\nThe problem is: Because the takeoff ramp is a vertical velocity limit ramp for the nice user experience but the acceleration feed-forward can add on top of the output and depending on trajectory generation result in unwanted thrust changes during the ramp.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nI suppress the vertical acceleration feed-forward during the ramp.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nIt's reproducable in SITL with the correct configuration:\r\n`MPC_TKO_RAMP_T` 5, `MPC_JERK_MAX` 20\r\n1.

publish sensor_accel or sensor_gyro with raw data and temperature (if available)\r\n - integrate raw data and publish every 2500 us (this is what the estimator consumes) to sensor_accel_integrated or sensor_gyro_integrated\r\n - register a character device (/dev/accelX or /dev/gyroX) and implement a few simple IOCTLs for getting the device id and setting calibration\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as the system evolved to this current state a number of implicit ordering assumptions around these interfaces slipped in. I only recently discovered real cases where this is violated.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n - sensors module assuming temperature compensation (sensor_correction) is ordered the same as sensor_accel_integrated/sensor_gyro_integrated\r\n - sensors module pushes calibration into drivers via IOCTL (/dev/accelX or /dev/gyroX)\r\n      - if the character device ordering doesn't match sensor_accel_integrated/sensor_gyro_integrated ordering then the enable/disable parameters will be wrong\r\n - calibration is done in sensor_accel/sensor_gyro order, then pushed into drivers in character device order\r\n      - this can go unnoticed because it will be \"fixed\" on the next parameter update when the sensors module reloads the parameters\r\n\r\nWe've mostly gotten away with this because typically all interfaces are created at the same time when starting the driver, but with the new drivers some (eg mpu6000) are performing longer more thorough reset procedures.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nTo solve this and clean up some legacy I've finished purging the accel and gyro character devices and IOCTLs. Then in all remaining usage of the uORB messages we don't allow any assumptions about ordering (always checking the device id field).\r\n\r\n - calibration is completely removed from the drivers and handled \"downstream\" in the sensors module (SensorCalibration helper)\r\n - drv_accel.h and drv_gyro.h completely gone along with all IOCTLs for accel and gyro\r\n - calibration no longer needs to be cleared existing before starting\r\n - temperature calibration (TC) remove all scale (SCL) parameters\r\n   - gyro and baro scale are completely unused\r\n   - regular accel calibration scale can be used (CAL_ACC*_xSCALE)\r\n - temperature calibration: use regular accel & gyro offsets used on top of temperature calibration (if available) instead of modifying the TC offsets\r\n      - I believe this makes more sense than modifying the TC parameters, but it may need to be discussed\r\n           - some setups have specific read only memory for storing factory calibration, so we can't tweak the offsets later or store the scale factors\r\n           - this way only the temperature_calibration module needs to know about the TC parameters their ordering relative to sensor_accel\r\n - I originally started this months ago and was going to save it for v1.12 (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/14237), but it's worth finishing now to resolve these potential problems.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n - [x] consider transitioning old TC_ SCL (scale factors) to regular accel scale (all the logs I could find had a scale factor error ~ 1% or less)\r\n - [ ] test everywhere (including configurations with temperature compensation enabled) and compare calibrations \r\n\r\n### Future Work\r\n - update sensor_mag calibration similarly\r\n      - mags aren't immune to the issues above, but it's less likely with only a single sensor_mag topic, no temperature calibration, and simpler drivers (no FIFO or integration)\r\n - move all IMU integration down to sensors/vehicle_imu\r\n      - the goal is to remove virtually all processing from the high rate, high priority sensor bus threads \r\n - use full sensor_gyro_fifo for filtering in vehicle_angular_velocity\r\n -

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nWhen the attitude estimate quaternion is reset the attitude controller uses the new reference in the next loop iteration. But the attitude setpoint is not updates to the new reference until the position controller generates a new attitude setpoint but it runs in a much slower rate. As a result there are glitches in the output rate setpoint. See https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/14676#issuecomment-617969679\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThe internal setpoint copy is updated with the delta quaaternion upon attitude estimate reset.

the bug**\r\nAfter a few calls `uavcan param <list/get/set>`, I encounter a hardfault that leads to a reboot.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Black Cube (`px4_fmu-v3_default`) running latest PX4 master branch\r\n2. Power via USB\r\n3. Attach a Here2 GPS to CAN1 (the \"real\" CAN1)\r\n4. Connect to serial console via an FTDI adapter\r\n5. Call `uavcan status` to ensure UAVCAN is running (this will produce a crap ton of node-spin and vehicle_air_data errors, these don't appear in v1.10...).

We don't know if this is a new issue, or whether this already existed before, since we have not flown this setup so extensively before. We also only recently plumbed the vision system's velocity estimate through to PX4, so it's easy to confirm the issue now.\r\n\r\n*EDIT: older logs (~1 mo old - upstream `d7a9b123e6b84df4a7c01daaac64706c39abd3d7`) don't show this velocity offset, and have lower vibration levels. I think the on-sensor DLPF was disabled between then and now.* https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=ff62827a-7eff-45c6-b2e6-6ea22cd087c6\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5557676/80012224-f8aae200-849a-11ea-8594-8472c7f0853b.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe velocity estimate matches the one provided by the vision system, which is accurate and has been benchmarked against groundtruth. Also the vehicle was flying in a straight line, and that velocity offset wasn't actually there in real life.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nHere are two logs from boot illustrating the issue. The first one is without velocity fusion enabled, and the second one is with velocity fusion enabled (which doesn't make much of a difference).\r\n\r\n1.

PR contains the following improvement:**\r\nAt the start of a front transition the fixed wing position controller creates a virtual position setpoint which is located 1000m in front of the vehicle. This avoids the controller tracking waypoints which are too close to the vehicle, e.g. loiter waypoints.\r\nIt would of course be nicer if the navigator would automatically publish this setpoint. However, this would take quite some changes and I'm not comfortable with the attempt just before a release.\r\nAlso, the logic in the position controller is straight forward and can be removed very easily. \r\n\r\n**This PR fixes the following bug:**\r\nA takeoff followed by a transition command lead to the vehicle doing a flyaway. This was because the takeoff code did not set valid latitude and longitude for the takeoff waypoint but still set the _can_loiter_at_sp flag to true. As a result the loiter code did not set a position setpoint but just copied over the NAN values.\r\nFinally, the position controller did not know what to do with that and just did nothing.\r\n\r\nI think this bug was introduced with flighttasks as they support of NAN position setpoint.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14727/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14721","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14721/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14721/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14721/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14721","id":604216602,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MDQyMTY2MDI=","number":14721,"title":"Takeoff denied in HITL Simulation with Gazebo","user":{"login":"jank324","id":17012833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDEyODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17012833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324","html_url":"https://github.com/jank324","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jank324/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10884838,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg4NDgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":552258139,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTIyNTgxMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/hitl","name":"hitl","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"hardware in the loop simulation"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2020-04-21T19:08:08Z","updated_at":"2021-09-09T09:27:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen running a HITL setup with Gazebo, I can arm (the rotors in Gazebo start spinning) but I cannot takeoff. QGC's error message is only \"Takeoff command temporarily rejected\". In the log it says \"Critical: Takeoff denied! Please disarm and retry\". Doing so leads to the same result.\r\nA SITL setup with Gazebo works fine. Using JMavSim in a HITL setup works perfectly, too.\r\nOne difference I have noticed when comparing my error scenario to the two that work: QGC says the value of Alt (Rel) is NaN (or --.-- on the HUD).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install the development toolchain according to the [Toolchain Installation](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/setup/dev_env.html).\r\n2. Follow the [instructions for setting up a HITL simulation](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/simulation/hitl.html) with Gazebo.\r\n    a) In step 4 of the Simulation Setup for Gazebo I use `/dev/tty.usbmodem01` on my MacBook Pro. On an iMac I've had to use `/dev/tty.usbmodem1`.\r\n    b) In a recent commit the iris world was removed, so instead of running Gazebo as in step 5 of the Gazebo Setup section, I've had to run `make px4_sitl gazebo` again to achieve the same result. I have already had the described problem before this change was made.\r\n3. After starting QGC in step 6 of the instructions for the Gazebo Setup, arm the drone and select Takeoff in QGC.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe drone should takeoff without errors and I should be able to see that it does so in the Gazebo client.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\nFlight log file: [Log file

more on the hover thrust.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe scale should be adjusted by a constant hover thrust independent factor for compatibility and then the parameter replaced with a rescaled

problem solved by this pull request**\r\nAdjusting the tilt limit can lead to diverging position control and should only be used by setting a sanity limit for the controller and not to adjust during the descent phase of a Land or RTL. Otherwise it leads to flyaways in important failsafe modes when there's stronger disturbance e.g. wind.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nI removed all occurances where flight tasks sets a tilt limit. All of them except for the one in AutoMapper's `_prepareLandSetpoints()` were setting the maximum redundantly. The auto land point one was causing the position control divergence on RTL and Land descend.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nAs discussed with @RomanBapst the goal landing strategy is to relax xy position control and ramp down the thrust gradually on ground contact as a next step of improvement.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nI did quite some tests in SITL using different wind strengths made possible by @Jaeyoung-Lim 's efforts like https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/pull/461\r\n\r\nIt has to be said that before https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/12324 this tilt limit was

the bug**\r\nWhen the UAV is armed (via RC), some AUX pwm outputs (actuator_outputs_1) shortly go to a lower value, although this is not commanded via an actuator_control message. It seems that this only happens with AUX outputs who's PWM_AUX_DIS is set.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. change PWM_AUX_DIS2 (or another) from -1 to 100\r\n2. (set SDLOG_MODE 0 -> 1)\r\n3. pre-arm UAV via onboard arm-switch\r\n4. arm via RC\r\n5. see in log: during 2nd arming the actuator_outputs_1[1] goes down for a short while\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe output should be following the commanded value via the mixer file, thus stay constant.\r\n\r\n**Log Files and Screenshots**\r\n*Always* provide a link to the flight log file:\r\n- 1st log: modified firmware [PX4 Flight Review](https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=45d2537b-d485-4103-9a95-22cfb1819fef), [AUX output

1050 and ramps up to commanded value.\r\nUsed mixer: \r\nactuator_outputs_1[0] = actuator_control_0[7] (landing gear)\r\nactuator_outputs_1[1] = actuator_control_2[1] (mount pitch)\r\nactuator_outputs_1[2] = actuator_control_2[4] (mount custom)\r\n\r\n- 2nd log: PX4 v1.10.0, vmount enabled [PX4 Flight

the bug**\r\nI found this issue during the tiltrotor flight test. After pre-arm button at GPS pixhawk 4 was pressed to disarm vehicle in fixed-wing mode, buzzer alarmed \"long beep (arming tone)\" that is the sound of \"arm state\" instead of only \"double short beep (disarming tone)\". This is so weird and makes me scared of motor spinup unintentionally (but motors did not spinup).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Press pre-arm button at GPS to make vehicle ready for arming, then arm vehicle in multirotor state via RC transmitter. Motors spinup at idle PWM.\r\n2. zero RC throttle, then activate transition switch to fixed-wing. Motors stop spinning, tilt-servos move down to horizontal position.\r\n3. At fixed-wing state, press \"pre-arm button again\" to disarm vehicle. (because I don't want to go back to multirotor state again before disarming vehicle)\r\n4. You will hear the \"disarming tone as double short beep\" follow by \"arming warning tone as long beep\" suddenly. No motor spinning, tilt-servos t return to disarm position (vertical).\r\n \r\nref. of tune meanings\r\nhttps://docs.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/getting_started/tunes.html\r\n\r\nvideo link:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/13HWmceGjHeR9kE2br4Sv5yqyTqhRS3Sb/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter press pre-arm button to disarm vehicle in fixed-wing mode, \"double short beep\" alarms to notice user that vehicle is going to be in disarm state. No \"arm tone\" until vehicle is armed by RC transmitter or QGC.\r\n\r\n**Drone (please complete the following information):**\r\nDescribe the type of drone: Tiltrotor using E-flite Convergence airframe\r\nHardware: Pixhawk4 + GPS pixhawk 4 + Holybro telemetry\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},
