						<td>Fix invalid offboard setpoints for fw pos control</td>
						<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/20669</td>
						<td>### Solved Problem
This commit fixes a regression that caused problems when trying to use offboard control with fixedwings (or VTOLs in fixedwing mode)

The problem was that all offboard setpoints were considered invalid in offboard mode:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5248102/203829851-55e1195d-9498-44be-aa6e-1e67db5f7ae5.png)

### Solution
This was a regression introduced by https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19942, where the valid flag in position_setpoint_triplet was no longer being used and the offboard logic was left out.

### Test coverage
Tested in SITL Gazebo and publishing offboard setpoints

## Describe problem solved by this pull request
This is to address what was reported here: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1277934841

What I think was going on:
- RTL triggered a couple of times, and each time it was above the return altitude, so didnâ€™t have to climb. In the v1.13 RTL logic, as pointed out [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/19928#issuecomment-1284454859), the mission_item.loiter_radius field wasn't filled, and it just kept using it as initialized. 
- The initialization happens in the constructor, and it initializes it to `_navigator->get_loiter_radius()`, which itself just gets the value of `_param_nav_loiter_rad`. At this moment, the params are though not yet fetched (happens [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/c267cf71c3aa57fbbe544d02f3b25650f029384d/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L151))
- in the [flight](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=4a466655-3c02-4f78-ab9e-1d90bca4b8e3) linked in the above mentioned issue , the initialisation value of it seems to have been 3.9e32, which was then passed through to the `position_setpoint_current.loiter_radius` (there is only a check for if(>0)), and the vehicle started on it's voyage around the solar system


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/197223431-d4a5a3c5-33ee-4655-8974-32d73cfc8abb.png)


## Describe your solution
On current main we by accident fixed this particular issue already,[ as we explicitly set the loiter_radius](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/ed558e199faab703ea3fb352db16512981fdb7ec/src/modules/navigator/rtl.cpp#L407) in every state of the RTL state machine. This wasn't the case in v1.13, but I guess we should back port it.
Additionally we should change the initialization of mission_item. I propose here to initialize to 0, which is considered as "invalid" before and not used in then (checks for ISFINITE and >FLT_EPS). 
I did the same for mission_item.acceptance_radius. 

## Describe possible alternatives
- do we have a way to update the params before the constructor is called?
- should we initialize `mission_item` fields consistently to NAN instead of some to NAN (currently yaw, lat, lon), and some to 0, and some not at all (e.g. altitude). And is this initialization in the constructor even needed?

The heading estimate is very unstable (a jump of >90 degrees at the 1:12 mark), after which the drone is almost uncontrollable, since all orientations are messed up. This has started happening repeatedly, but we have also made more than 10 flights before where the issue did not arise.

I have noticed that the EKFs are also using the internal magnetometer, while it is set at a lower priority and the external magnetometer does produce data.

If anyone can assist (even if only giving some pointers on how to analyse this issue) that'd be greatly appreciated.</td>

**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
Eli Vigdorchik ran into an undesired external quadchute during one of his test flights as reported on slack (https://px4.slack.com/archives/C39C4E709/p1622652580039900). Log here: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=26c65922-793b-4bad-88fa-86f58b97eb82 . For some reason Param2 of the command is set to 3, triggering the Quadchute instead of doing a normal back transition during RTL. I was able to reproduce in SITL on v1.12.0-beta and on master. I guess the issue is a badly initialized / old value of param2 floating around somewhere.
https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=efaae0f0-a8a8-494c-b32d-6e041689836f
https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=e177614d-a4c1-4ebf-97ca-6ed6fb8cf420

**Describe your solution**
Explicitly set Param2 to 0.0f in all occurrences where a normal BT is desired (I searched for all occurrences of *DO_VTOL_TRANSITION in the code).

I also added a check on NANs. If param2 is a NAN, then _immediate_transition is false too.

**Describe possible alternatives**
- 

**Test data / coverage**
Same procedure, i.e. Position mode flight with RTL triggered over QGC:
https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=7cc61dad-7145-4e81-9ee3-f7c84dd04ef9

I also tried manual transitions, transitions over QGC, missions with VTOL Land and normal Land items, `commander transition` and switching to Land mode via QGC. I couldn't provoke any external quadchutes. Did I miss another option to get into back transition?

							<td>vtol_att_control: occasional tailsitter forward transition failure</td>
							<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17310</td>
							<td>
Tailsitter VTOLs very occasionally gets stuck with zero roll and pitch angle in multicopter mode after
a forward transition command is issued.

Log files with the transition failure:
https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d3c74285-5ae5-430d-a1bd-1b4e6de13938
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=8d86e43c-5570-4480-9123-7e25669c5463

In the above logs you can see the pitch and roll sp set to zero during the forward transition. 

This very rare behavior is triggered by the following events:
1> a forward transition is triggered either in auto or manual mode.
2> in the vtol_att_control main loop, if multicopter and fixed wing attitude setpoints are not updated, transition state is not updated
3> the commander changes the vehicle status to transition mode.
4> multicopter pos controller initiated  Transition flight task. This results in zero roll and pitch setpoint due to zero acceleration setpoint
5> now vtol_att_control executes and updates the transition state. Specifically, _q_trans_start and _q_trans_sp are set with zero roll and pitch sp
6> tilt is evaluated to be NaN, despite _q_trans_sp being normalized. This happens for 25% of all yaw angles when using float datatype. This can be
   verified using the matrix library
7> once tilt is evaluated to be NaN, _q_trans_sp is never updated again and is stuck in this state for ever.

This has been fixed by constraining the cos(tilt) within +1 to -1 range
Further, _q_trans_start and _q_trans_sp are immedietly initialized after a transition event is triggered.

						<td>Handle takeoff waypoints for rover</td>
						<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16297</td>
						<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
Previously, rover vehicles were not able to handle Takeoff waypoints. The behavior when a takeoff waypoint was passed to a rover vehicle was:
- The vehicle would not move since the waypoint was too close
- The takeoff waypoint would not get accepted since rovers are not able to climb and reach the altitude

I think it might be obvious that one "should not" pass takeoff waypoints to a vehicle. However, QGroundControl only lets you plan a mission that starts with a takeoff waypoint. While this should also be an improvement on the QGC side, I think it is still useful to handle this case on the vehicle side so that the vehicle can still progress with the mission even with a takeoff waypoint

**Describe your solution**
This adds a special case when handling takeoff waypoints for rover vehicles. The acceptance radius is set to only consider horizontal distance to the waypoint, if the vehicle type is rover.

**Test data / coverage**
- This was tested in SITL gazebo, with the rover model.

When we are performing a VTOL transition with a tailsitter type drone We are getting very weird thrust fluctuations. It seems that it's taking two references basically at the same time, I would assume from the MC and FW controllers.
Also in simulation we don't get this issue.

More over @xdwgood also reported this issue on PX4 slack, thus proving that this issue is on upstream PX4 and not custom software.

						<td>**Describe the bug**

If we do not connect the USB to a consumer right after the bootloader, once the RGB LED starts breathing blue (in a window of few seconds), the Pixhawk is inaccessible, no message can be received or sent anymore, but the TTY ACM driver is still up and running, thinking it can communicate.

I could replicate the exact same behavior going one level down, using `libusb1.0` instead of using the kernel `usb-cdc-acm` driver but the exact same behavior happened. This seems to indicate that the last burst would come from the Pixhawk's buffer and not the tty driver buffer. As the log shows below, if nobody subscribes to the data in `/dev/ttyACM0`, the USB connection is not initialized.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Power the Pixhawk with the USB
2. Wait for the LED to be blue breathing
3. Wait an additional 10 seconds
4. Try to connect Mavros, QGc or `cat /dev/ttyACM0`
5. When connecting, few messages are received
6. The connection hangs: No message can be sent or received

Steps to reproduce the behavior after successful connection:
1. Power the Pixhawk with the USB
2. Wait for the LED to be blue breathing
3. ~Wait an additional 10 seconds~
4. Try to connect Mavros, QGc or `cat /dev/ttyACM0`
5. The connection is successful and can be used for any time you want
6. Disconnect (stop the node)
7. Wait 10 seconds
8. Try to reconnect with the same method
9. When connecting, few messages are received
10. The connection hangs: No message can be sent or received

**Expected behavior**

Steps to reproduce the behavior after successful connection:
1. Power the Pixhawk with the USB
2. Wait for the LED to be blue breathing
3. You can wait any time you want before connecting
4. Try to connect Mavros, QGc or `cat /dev/ttyACM0`
5. The connection is successful and can be used for any time you want

						<td>Possible attitude estimation bug</td>

						<td>**Describe the bug**
[Flight 1](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=70d80c6c-46f4-4d45-a710-bcc0ed0cae1c)
After ~30s of full manual indoor flight (~5m height above floor), the estimated attitude began to drift significantly in the roll angle (even in pitch, but not so much), even though the pose desired by the pilot was the hover state. The pilot tried to compensate by tilting the drone in the opposite direction, however, he reached the limit position of the roll stick on the RC and the roll still continued to drift. The high velocity led to a rough crash into a wooden bench. There was no RC signal loss and we checked that the RC had no trims and subtrims in effect.

This was the first time we experienced this behavior after ~4 years working with PX4 firmware.

[Flight 2](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=5dc3d4bb-5c16-4ec6-b7ad-17f2456e4f3b)
The second incident we had was the next day on the same location with different hardware, but the same symptoms. After ~30s of manual flight in altitude mode (~5m height above floor) the UAV started tilting uncontrollably and then crashed into a wall. Again no RC signal losses, no trims and subtrims. We were even flying with this platform the same day in the morning for ~10 minutes without any issues [(OK Flight)](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=e0c02122-4335-4ce3-ab3d-598a38e98c7f).

Please find attached logs and description of the hardware in the following sections. My colleague will also upload a video which compares the PX4 estimated attitude with the correctly estimated attitude obtained from a custom attitude estimator run on the recorded IMU flight data.

What is the cause of this behavior? Could there be a bug in the attitude estimator that only manifests in some highly specific conditions? Is there some problem apparent from the logs that we are missing?

Please ask for any relevant additional information that could help solving the issue. Until we resolve this issue we cannot fly indoor in this setup, because it is too unreliable and dangerous.

**To Reproduce**
We tried to reproduce the behavior in lower height above floor with another drone with the same setup as in the first flight without success.

						<td>While testing PR #15083 the vehicle was commanded to execute a mission, took off but failed to transition from Takeoff to Mission.

A workaround was to pause the mission and then continue the mission.

Mission with RTL
In 4/5 missions the vehicle tookoff and didn't went to the next waypoint, I think is related to the issue of the auto-takeoff, land flights. I needed to pause the mission or switch different flight mode and then click continue mission.

						<td>Poor Fixed wing runway takeoff tracking </td>
						<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14851</td>
						<td>Fixed wing runway takeoff tracking is very poor on various firmwares and aircraft types that i've been testing and had others test.

I've compiled some notes and logs on this and it was even brought up (in a different context) in https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/11785 but the more we look at it, the more this is a true issue and from a practical standpoint is making using autonomous takeoff not feasible given the high risk.

Let me also preface this by saying a many things have been tested and changed and a makeshift solution was come up with as well but that doesn't solve the problem. Wheel Rate settings have been altered to various extreme and subdued amounts (as seen in the logs). This has reduced some things present like sudden full wheel deflection upon mission start but it never fixes the trajectory of the takeoff and that it does not generally point or aim to the takeoff waypoint but goes off course many time more than it does not.

Multiple different aircraft and aircraft types were used, even though the mixer is the same, that is only because we have varying sizes and weights of test aircraft and even foam ones where the setup, weight and geometry on the nose gear and linkages is completely different (which is good to rule out a single hardware type or build as the culprit).

I often have seen the wheel channel output (main 5) swing up and down 500us over neutral, essentially max on both extremes and even when that isnt having the same type of behavior exists at +/200. The scaling factor probably helps in these cases by reducing movement (so long as you are still on course enough or at least not going to crash on takeoff) but the thing to remember is this entire process is only 3-8 seconds long before you're airborne so it's easy to not see or overlook.

The hacked solution? Limit min/max pwm value of the wheel servo either in PX4 or at the servo level to limit how much steering can physically occur. This is not a solution but gets things airborne by quasi limiting the ability to go off course. Not a true solution.

										<td>mc_pos_control: fix takeoff ramp gets amended by feed-forward</td>
										<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14821</td>
										<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
I found an issue with the takeoff ramp when real world testing https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/14749 on the Holybro QAV250. But I found the issue is independent of that pr.

The thrust doesn't ramp nicely anymore like it was designed but depending on stick input can go up and down unexpectedly during the ramp up. This can lead to early land detection if the thrust goes up high enough and then back down because the ramp is not yet high enough.

The problem is: Because the takeoff ramp is a vertical velocity limit ramp for the nice user experience but the acceleration feed-forward can add on top of the output and depending on trajectory generation result in unwanted thrust changes during the ramp.

**Describe your solution**
I suppress the vertical acceleration feed-forward during the ramp.

**Test data / coverage**
It's reproducable in SITL with the correct configuration:
`MPC_TKO_RAMP_T` 5, `MPC_JERK_MAX` 20
1. Switch to position mode
2. Arm

										<td>Unstable GPS data while using the 2nd telemetry on TELEM2 port - v1.11.0-beta1</td>
										<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14659</td><td>**Describe the bug**
Hi, I found very strange GPS behavior after uploaded "v1.11.0-beta1" to pixhawk 4. Firstly, I configured MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2 (My UAV has been flown using this config. before since firmware v1.8.2, v1.9.2 and v1.10.2 and I got no error). Then, I investigated using"mavlink inspector" in QGC and take a look at GPS_RAW_INT. 

GPS signal seems unstable, the fluctuation ranges from 0 to 5 Hz. It should be a constant value or nearly constant (compared with an older firmware, I have already tested before).

Finally, the result is the flight mode could not be changed from ALTITUDE to POSITION, No Green GPS LED light visible. I managed the test as follows 

**To Reproduce / Test Case**
Case 1: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK
MAV_1_CONFIG = Disabled
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=9764baca-ec06-40aa-b1ba-79719d0b75fc

Case 2: v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning
MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=a670c429-592e-4e52-a200-b811bd45f14d

Case 3: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK
MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM/SERIAL4 
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=98b8c1ec-d492-48b5-823a-870af29e5686

Case 4:  v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning
MAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM2  

Case 5: v1.11.0-beta1 --> OK
MAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM/SERIAL4 

Case 6: v1.11.0-beta1 --> Error / ubx msg warning
MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM/SERIAL4 
MAV_2_CONFIG =  TELEM2  

Case 7: v1.10.1 --> OK (compare to Case 2 v1.11.0-beta1. It is not the same result even config. is the same)
MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=29bea816-da9d-4cd4-b042-c0fdb14e489d

The error is the same whether telemetry is available on that port or not, indoor or outdoor if I configure MAV_X_CONFIG to TELEM2. According to the flight log of Case 2, you will see the strange GPS behavior at "GPS Uncertainty and GPS Noise & Jamming". In every test case, Telemetry works fine.

However, GPS works fine if I upload the older firmware "v1.10.1" (v1.8.2 / v1.9.2 is the same) Is it firmware bug ? or Did I miss anything?

									<td>Battery emergency RTL initiate climb command, even if drone already landing</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14479</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
I found on a flight that I have came to nearly empty battery that there is something that look to me like bug in the emergency and critical battery logic.
I started to land in nearly empty battery, but then the emergency battery logic intiated, and instead of continue landing, it started to RTL (climbing), I took control to RC and landed.
it seems that COM_LOW_BAT_ACT doesn't respect the current flight mode, and if the drone has already started to land, it can re-initiate action, that might be climbing.

**To Reproduce**
 * in order to reproduce easily in simulator I have changed the next parameters:
BAT_LOW_THR = 30%
BAT_EMERGEN_THR  = 20%
BAT_CRIT_THR = 10%
COM_LOW_BAT_ACT = 3 (Return mode at critically low level, Land mode at current position if reaching dangerously low levels)
RTL_RETURN_ALT = 100m
SIM_BAT_MIN_PCT = 0%

 * take-off
 * fly to another location
 * climb to 20m
 * wait that the battery will get to ~30% and start land
 * the RTL will be initiated, starting with climbing (and here the bug)

**Expected behavior**
in case of already started landing, don't initiate RTL. and don't re-initiate landing

									<td>Fixed-wing position controller not ouputting attitude setpoints if GPS switched off in altitude mode</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14243</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
Fixed-wing altitude mode doesn't work without GPS data because it seems to run only with a [valid global position](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/18754225c93ee18c76c227cc66f687835e4a0046/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L1481). 
It is though currently possible to switch to altitude flight mode (at least for a VTOL) without a GPS connected.

**To Reproduce**
In sitl, fly a VTOL in fixed-wing mode or a plane, and disable GPS fusing in air by setting the EKF2_AID_MASK to 0. Switch to stabilized and back to altitude mode.

**Expected behavior**
I expect that altitude flight mode works without issues after a GPS loss (at least with valid baro data).
Till we have that we should disable the ability to switch to altitude flight mode if you don't have a valid global position (resp. for VTOL disable transition to FW mode in altitude mode).

**Log Files and Screenshots**
This is a sitl flight where I disabled GPS fusing in air (by setting the EKF2_AID_MASK to 0). When then switching out and in again into altitude flight mode, the attidue sp and control signals are frozen.

**Additional context**
I became aware of this problem recently while flying a VTOL without GPS sensor.

Should we maybe split TECS and L1 into separate modules @RomanBapst @dagar ? Just as an effort to disentangle this all a bit.

									<td>Issue with landing PixRacer FMUV4_K66, FMUv5</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13956</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
When flying the vehicle in Mission mode and trigger RTL, upon landing the vehicle does not descend vertically but drifts away with the wind. I had to take command of the vehicle in position mode and landed the vehicle manually. This is an issue that we have seen constantly, with the PixRacer and K66, FMUv5. **We are seeing this issue when the wind is 6 m/s and over.** 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Drone switched on 
2. Uploaded mission to the vehicle
3. Took off in Mission Mode 
4. All commands were sent form QGC (Armed and takeoff)
5. Once all waypoint completed vehicle switched to RTL
6. When the vehicle was landing, it did not descend vertically, drifted away with the wind and landed the vehicle manually

**Expected behavior**
The vehicle should land and disarm.

									<td>Pixhawk 3 Pro v4_ failed connection to the RC</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13892</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
The vehicle did not connect to RC, it would not let the user bind the RC nor calibrate, the same issue was noticed on Master it seems to be working on Stable firmware. This is a brand new flight controller shipped from Drotek, the previous flight controller had bad vibrations and the mag data looked bad. We suspect the issue was something electrical and the flight controller was replaced. Now we are having a failed connection to the RC.  

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Binding Procedure:

RC Steps:
1- Turn on RC
2- Activate Biding mode (RC will make beeping sounds)

Vehicle Steps:
"With the vehicle turned on"
1- Unplug the receptor
2- Press Binding button and keep pressed
3- Plug in receptor (without letting the binding button go) and make sure both red and green light of the receptor are turned on.
RC Step
1- Disable binding mode
Vehicle Step:
1- Confirm binding by having the receptor with a solid green light on (algo confirm by moving flight modes switches.)

									<td>Fix and add warnings for RTL with invalid landing</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/13873</td>
									<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
Currently RTL skips this segment of code which displays an error if the vehicle is unable to use the mission.:
`} else {
				// Otherwise use regular RTL.
				mavlink_log_critical(_navigator->get_mavlink_log_pub(), "RTL: unable to use mission landing");
			}`
We have also ran into issues with users missing this initial message. This has lead to users being confused as to why the fixedwing vehicle is not landing. 

**Describe your solution**
This gets rid of the dead code introduced previously, and fixes the bug with the warning message not being displayed. It also adds a message that displays every 30 seconds warning the user that the vehicle cannot use the mission landing. 

**Describe possible alternatives**
The best alternative would be to reject invalid missions and keep the current valid mission on the vehicle. This would get rid of an invalid landing being uploaded to the vehicle.  

**Test data / coverage**
This was tested in SITL
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=cfa987ce-62c4-4a50-b018-ca3456d892c3

A version of this has also been in use on our Fixedwing vehicles since August.

									<td>Altitude Fluctuation in Constant-Altitude Missions</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13793</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
When flying a basic mission with constant-altitude waypoints, the droneâ€™s altitude erroneously fluctuates. Our use-case requires a much more reliable altitude for precision deployment of sensors. Let me know if you can/can't reproduce this issue.

![altitudegrpah2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33331023/71501357-f2736480-281e-11ea-87d5-d1f1c158680b.PNG)

Notice how the estimated altitude doesn't follow the setpoint altitude in mission mode (purple region), but it follows exactly in position mode (green region). This shows that the instruments and sensors are capable of producing altitude-accurate flight.

I also posted this issue here: [https://discuss.px4.io/t/altitude-fluctuation-in-missions/14416](url)

**To Reproduce**
1. Use Pixhawk1 or Pixhawk Cube with 1.8.2, 1.9.2, or 1.10 firmware
2. Upload mission detailed below
3. Take off and start mission
4. See drone fluctuate 1-2 meters from setpoint.

Mission:

Mission Start - 0m
Takeoff - 8m rel to home
Waypoint - 8m rel to home, 5sec hold
Waypoint - 8m rel to home, 5sec hold
Waypoint - 8m rel to home
Waypoint - 8m rel to home
Waypoint - 8m rel to home
Waypoint - 8m rel to home

**Expected behavior**
I expect the drone's altitude to follow the setpoint altitude in mission mode with the same accuracy as position mode.

**Log Files Analysis**
[https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=624517a3-9159-415c-8974-4fc790206f6f](url)
More log files for different missions are available upon request. They have all resulted in the same issue--despite using different setpoint altitudes and types of waypoints.

**Drone**
This problem was reproduced on two drones; a Flamewheel 450 and a custom drone that is much larger--about 1 meter span between opposite motors. We tried multiple configurations for each drone consisting of Pixhawk 1, Pixhawk Cube, v1.8.2 PX4 and v1.9.2 PX4. For each Pixhawk, we used the standard recommended GPS. Both drones were adequately powered.

									<td>Bad system behavior when airspeed data disapears</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13697</td>
									<td>There is some bad system behavior we've observed in legacy firmware (between v1.8-v1.9) related to airspeed data disappearing, for example if the I2C bus flakes out or if power is lost to the airspeed sensor.

I submit this for review against the new airspeed selector work @sfuhrer and others are contributing in hopes the new airspeed features will robustly handle these difference cases.

If airspeed data suddenly disappears there are several bad behaviors:

1. The system seems to keep sending the last known airspeed reading down the MAVlink pipe to the ground station (might need to be verified).  It should instead stop sending airspeed data if no new data is available.

2. There are no warnings to the user that airspeed data has gone missing. There should be some warning inidcation if airspeed data is expected but disappeared.  There should also be an indication if it returns.  (note: similar data disappeared, data returned indications should be extended to all sensor types).

3. On a failed takeoff, if the autopilot stops receiving airspeed data, the LandDetector may think the vehicle is still flying because the last reported airspeed still seems to be piping into the system. The motor may still run at full throttle! Ideally airpseed would stop updating and "zero" or "null" would be reported and the system would understand that it should not be using airspeed as part of the LandDetector.

4. If airspeed disappears during flight there is no indication that it disappeared. TECS will silently switch to non-airspeed mode and not tell the user and by-passes the airspeed failsafe functionality. There should be warning indications and the airspeed failsafe functionality should be followed.

Here are some flight logs showing the last example of airspeed data disappearing during the middle of a flight:

It basically says GPS data is lagged because _gps_hgt_intermittent flag is on.

_gps_hgt_intermittent = !((_time_last_imu - gps_init.time_us) < 2 * GPS_MAX_INTERVAL);

However, it seems very difficult to meet this condition unless otherwise GPS has unstable connection. But it's not. It seems some timing issue.

After landing, I was able to run lifter motors, servos and pusher motor. The plane was able to take off and landing normally after landing. There was no hardware problem. You can see easily, there is long dropout on flightlog at all plots. You can watch the flight from "Open 3D View", the plane was flying backwards bcause of dropouts on log file.

									<td>**Firmware**: 1.9.2 (with #13312 and #13325)

**Describe the bug**
I'm seeing huge pitch/roll setpoints when switching from manual to position mode . It seems like it's the velocity controller, but I don't really understand how the velocity controller ends up demanding such large effort of the attitude controller. I've detuned the P gain on the velocity controller and am still seeing a violent jerk when switching from manual to position. Here's a log with 3 mode switch, the first one being the most violent.


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Switch from `manual` to `position` mode. The more velocity you have before the switch, the more violent the jerk.

This may not be a regular use-case, but while testing to reproduce #13350, I had a bad crash, which turns out was a hard-fault.

**Steps taken**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Drone with optical flow (pmw3901), GPS actively used. Commanded via MAVLink
2. Stopped the GPS driver
3. Take-off
4. `gps start -b 115200`
5. BOOM

**Elaboration**
I mention that the vehicle was commanded via MAVLink because I did the exact same test again immediately afterwards, with the only difference that I was using an RC and it did not hard-fault. I was scared to attempt to reproduce... Joysticks don't let you map a kill switch!

									<td>Commander mode offboard triggers PX4 freeze</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13309</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
Using px4_sitl_default together with gazebo and sending set_actuator_control_target via pymavlink successfully establishes a mavlink connection and actuator commands are received on the px4 stack and uorb topic offboard_control_mode is published. When using the system console and sending `commander mode offboard` the stack freezes. No uorb topics are published and no mavlink messages are received (gazebo plugin correspondingly outputs `[Err] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:1155] poll timeout` in the mavlink poll function). The pxh system console remains responsive but commands to any module (e.g. commander, uorb) have no effect and hence indicating the system wide freeze. No error message from PX4 is shown and gdb debugger catches no signals.

**To Reproduce**
- run `px4_sitl_default gazebo`
- send mavlink messages via pymavlink `c.mav.set_actuator_control_target_send(0, 0, 0, 0, controls)`
- switch to offboard mode using `commander mode offboard`

**Expected behavior**
Px4 was expected to switch `vehicle_control_mode` into offboard mode.

**Log Files and Screenshots**
- https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=86db944d-af82-456a-bb6c-79e8e5b223dd

**Additional context**
- PX4 firmware (v1.9.2)
- mavlink (release/kinetic/mavlink/2019.10.10-1)
- mavros (0.33.0)
- Approaches so far:
  - PX4_INFO() print outputs showed that commander reaches publishing in run() loop
  - gdb info variables and inspecting last variables gave no further insights

The freeze presumably happens after the system console arguments are parsed and published in the commander run loop. It could also be that the crash happens earlier and all modules get stuck at the file descriptor polling. Maybe a problem from global variables causing a race condition with the main commander thread? Maybe I am missing something but it does not seem that variable access is coordinated when parsing the mode argument.

Any advice on how to approach or debug this problem are very much appreciated!</td>

									<td>Land detector edge case in descend mode</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13231</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
The land detector seems to detect ground contact in Descend mode (RC land failsafe without GPS).

1. `vertical_movement` to be `false`: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/95dc522b99688a08402ac6462ad28f5dfd338eda/src/modules/land_detector/MulticopterLandDetector.cpp#L154
2. `hit_ground` to be `true`: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/95dc522b99688a08402ac6462ad28f5dfd338eda/src/modules/land_detector/MulticopterLandDetector.cpp#L165

This happens because the z controller only reacts slowly to the new setpoint so the z velocity down is much less than the z velocity setpoint here:
https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/95dc522b99688a08402ac6462ad28f5dfd338eda/src/modules/land_detector/MulticopterLandDetector.cpp#L151-L154

One observation of the descend case is that the velocity setpoint jumps to the land speed instead of gradually reaching it like in Land (with GPS) mode.

![bokeh_plot(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1419688/67103273-14b88880-f1c5-11e9-932a-827e357f7cc7.png)


**To Reproduce**
This is hard to reproduce in SITL because the drone seems to follow the setpoint quicker.

**Expected behavior**
It should not detect ground contact until actually landed.

**Log Files and Screenshots**

This happened in a failsafe descend test:

									<td>Offboard position setpoints with loiter type mask makes Fixed wing vehicle fly away</td>
									<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/13180</td>
									<td>**Describe the bug**
Offboard position setpoints with loiter type masks result in a fly away of a fixed wing vehicle. The roll and pitch setpoints are set to zero and continues to fly to the last direction where offboard mode was triggered. The offboard position setpoints fly as expected without the loiter type mask.

![Screenshot from 2019-10-14 12-05-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5248102/66743792-fe37c780-ee7a-11e9-8d67-0b0f06dd44d1.png)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Take off FW vehicle in SITL
2. Send `SET_POSITION_LOCAL_NED` setpoint with `type_mask=0x3000` ([see](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_receiver.cpp#L774)
3. Swich mode to offboard mode


**Expected behavior**
The FW vehicle circles around the loiter setpoint

**Log Files and Screenshots**
The [log](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=8617fe45-3269-4098-9165-e94b176d74a4) shows the offboard setpoint resulting in a fly away. A local position setpoint of [0.0, 0.0, 20.0] was being streemed with`type_mask=0x3000`

**Additional context**
Currently flying offboard position setpoints are passed as a reference position for the L1 controller, which results the vehicle turning around and traversing the setpoint as can be seen [here](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=209a8f30-a2aa-45f1-85b0-6755170b88a2). Supporting circling the waypoints may be useful for various robotic applications using fixed wing.

I've seen a bug where the distance sensor CM8JL65 switches the uORB topic it is publishing on, mid-air. This doesn't seem to bother EKF2 much, but it still doesn't sound like a great idea.

This was seen when testing a rebased version of https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/12950, but I don't think the issue is related to the PR.

Would be interesting to know if anybody has seen similar behavior with other sensors, or if this is more likely a bug in the CM8JL65 driver.

										<td>Logger stopped completely during flight?</td>
										<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12565</td>
										<td>**Describe the bug**
We did 4 flight tests on Tuesday, the first two logged fine, the last two stopped logging during fight. The other parts of the system were working as usual so I didn't even notice anything until reading the logs and finding out most of it is missing.
I am logging everything at the highest rates so I am not surprised by the frequent dropouts, but why did it just go off completely? 

Now I am trying to increase the buffer size by multiplying it in line 283. [https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/36534d5bab3d6a73f146e671df1b8f40772174b7/src/modules/logger/logger.cpp#L283](http://url)
Multiplying it by 4 makes the dropouts less frequent but sometimes the buffer still saturates. If I try to multiply it by 5 the logger won't start at all. Why there is a limit? 
The stack size seems unaffected but I try to increase it to 5000 anyway, making no difference.

**Expected behavior**
I would expect the logging to resume after the buffer clears up, not just to stop completely.
Also maybe the way to increase the buffer correctly is not completely clear to me.

**Log Files and Screenshots**
Here the logging stopped even before takeoff. There is 10+ minutes of flight missing.

										<td>Fixedwing position controller not able follow position setpoints in offboard mode</td>
										<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/12517</td>
										<td>**Describe the bug**
When streaming position setpoints to the fixed wing vehicle, it can enter offboard mode as the setpoint is sreamed. However, rather than following the setpoints (usually defined in local coordinates) it simply flies straight. 

This seems to be because the fixed wing position controller blindly reads from the setpoints in global coordinates from the position_setpoint_triplets.

https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp#L854-L855

**To Reproduce**
1. Run SITL and start mission while streaming position_setpoints through mavros with setpoint_raw messages to takeoff and loiter
2. After takeoff, switch vehicle to offboard mode

**Expected behavior**
When given a position setpoint, the desired behavior is to use it as a reference for the L1 position controller.

**Log Files and Screenshots**
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=f6204199-f876-4253-8d12-cb454c1e816b

**Additional context**
Attitude setpoints for offboard mode in fixed wing is currently working. However, to use this a l1 like path tracking controller needs to be implemented on the companion side to make it usable. Being able to stream position setpoints to a fixed wing drone would greatly simplify the interface for robotic applications in fixed wing</td>

												<td>part of a related discussion with @LorenzMeier @RomanBapst @dagar here https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/11883#discussion_r278098852

We sometimes see poor initial climb out performance on our hand-launched fixed wing. Looking at some logs it is not achieving the target pitch angle (15 deg), but the control system isn't trying very hard to get there.

Might there be an integrator issue or is something else going on with airspeed and gain scaling?

												<td>[ecl/EKF] EKF stopping navigation in every flight</td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/11071</td>
												<td>Hello,

I am constantly getting this error in my flights: "[ecl/EKF] EKF stopping navigation". I am using a PX4FLOW and a Lidar Lite v3 for range data and I am flying without GPS. I am using fmu-v3 (master) with a small alteration to make the Lidar boot before the PX4FLOW (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/11009).

From the logs I see that my local position estimates vary wildly at the beginning until I get the error and, after that, the estimating stops (obviously). However, the condition_local_position_valid flag drops to zero even before EKF stops navigation and it never goes back to one. Here is an example of a short test I did this morning:

https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=95d3f262-f3ef-4dea-9398-91dcce53d245

I was flying outdoors and neither take-off nor landing were exactly smooth. I thought it might be an issue with the PX4FLOW, but I have tried both indoors and outdoors flights on floors with different textures and the quality data I get seems to be good enough. Also, even though the acceleration power spectral density data is not ideal, I get much better values indoors and yet I still get the same error, so I doubt vibration is an issue.

Any ideas?

												<td>survey control lost at turn point</td>

												<td>Performing a survey, we saw a weird behaviour at the first turn point. Reaching the turning point, the copter started to tumble violently and loose height. Quickly toggling to altitude and then position to stop the mission didn't stop the behaviour. The machine crashed into the ground tumbling, stayed grounded for a few seconds, and took off again, now hovering stable in position mode.

The tumbling seems to start with a jump of the yaw setpoint. At mission start the machine had a successfully yaw into flight direction however.

The tuning and general reaction tested before the survey in position and altitude mode seemed very stable.

Any hints on possible reasons are very appreciated!

												<td>Too many false positive "Preflight Fail: HIGH IMU ACCEL BIAS" warning messages</td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/10833</td>
												<td>**Problem:**

We are getting a lot of false positive "Preflight Fail: HIGH IMU ACCEL BIAS" warning messages preventing arming.  This seems to have started in master this past spring and continues in stable 1.8.0.  I believe a lot of other PX4 users are getting these false positive warnings as well.

- (Note: in recent master the text of this warning as changed to "Preflight Fail: High Accelerometer Bias")

This happens to us frequently on known good aircraft that are great fliers and continue to fly great once the fault is cleared. 

We recently noticed the error seems correlated to a vehicle sitting level on the ground for some period of time.  @priseborough made a helpful suggestion to try pitching and rolling the vehicle slowly so that the X and Y accels could spend some time facing down (gravity) and EKF2 could better estimate their bias.  This worked to clear the error!  Here is an example of the error which was then easily cleared by pitching and rolling the vehicle:
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=278fa376-2a02-4027-b465-12507dbc9062

**Possible solution:**
It has been suggested that using the bias state uncertainty as a factor in the bias level check could help eliminate false positives.  The bias level check in Commander could use the already existing additional information from EKF2 for this.


**Further support:**

Anecdotally I know of this exact ACCEL BIAS warning happening to handfuls of other PX4 users, many of whom do not post to Github or Discuss.

There are a large number of github issues and PX4Discuss posts about getting this error.  Probably there are many complicating factors involved with each report, but the fact that there are so many makes me believe there is a systemic issue with the check, or the checks and warnings need to be more specific.

As you can see we were just adjusting the altitude setpoint and nothing else.

I then tested this in SITL using `make posix_sitl_default gazebo` and issued via QGroundControl a **`goto`** command and saw the vehicle fly to the new location, but then fly super far an a random direction for a while, then returns back to that location, wanders around a bit more, flys off in the opposite direction... then I got bored of watching.

												<td>MPC_LAND_ALT1 and MPC_LAND_ALT2 should be used for a final approach speed during landing.
According to the param spec the vehicle should descend at MPC_Z_VEL_MAX_DN speed and slow down between MPC_LAND_ALT1 and MPC_LAND_ALT2 to MPC_LAND_SPEED.

There is a massive energy consumption benefit in having this

Currently this is not implemented in the FlightTask: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/bee6a6b8b08d30b36475628e0750edcb6038d798/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/AutoMapper/FlightTaskAutoMapper.cpp#L117

The params are used for takeoff which does not seem to be documented behavior: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/bee6a6b8b08d30b36475628e0750edcb6038d798/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/AutoMapper/FlightTaskAutoMapper.cpp#L128

Perhaps implementing it as indicated currently is not a good idea, the altitudes default to 10 and 5m above home and we might be flying over a different altitude.

There are a few options on how this can be implemented safely;
1. Within a small radius around home / for RTL only
2. Only when a range finder is installed
3. If QGC has given the terrain altitude
4. When enabled by a param
5. When enabled in the waypoint (explicitly chosen in QGC)

If there are any other ideas on how to do this please share.

Auto modes `land` and `rtl` cause quad to fly directly towards home lat/lon/alt. This is the third time I've seen this in two weeks. I've seen it ~10 times since the introduction of FlightTasks. We are flying ~7 hours a week, so this is a very rare edge case bug. Logging either dies completely or drops out when this happens. I finally have a partial log (2 minute long dropout) of a flight where this happened. 

**To Reproduce**
1. Takeoff using mode `takeoff`
2. Fly around in position mode
3. Issue `land` or `rtl`
4. This behavior will persist through a land/disarm/arm/takeoff

**Additional context**
I am pretty sure `takeoff` is causing the bug. I am fairly certain `navigator` gets stuck in a loop somewhere, this would explain the logger dropouts due to thread starvation (navigator priority is higher than logger). I am guessing all `auto` modes will cause this, we only use `land` and `rtl`, but both of those modes do the same thing, fly right towards home.</td>

												<td>I am having an issue with a very heavy prototype VTOL that I'm building and I am seeing an issue that I am not sure where this behavior could be coming from. As I am hovering, sometimes the bird yaws hard and loses altitude. I think the fact I lose altitude indicates to me that we don't have enough thrust to push through the decent caused by spooling down half of the motors in the yaw.

While I have been digging through the logs, I noticed a point where the yaw setpoint jump sharply at 7:36. I also noticed a baro EKF error and would that case an EKF reset on the mags which could cause a sharp heading change?

I feel like this might just be a poor calibration and tune but I thought I would ping you to see if you have any great ideas.

												<td>Navigator: Fix fixed-wing first order altitude hold</td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/9850</td>
												<td>**Issue**
Navigator's fixed-wing first-order altitude hold (FOH) is currently causing altitude reference oscillations when in any LOITER mode. See screenshot below. Not only altitude, but also pitch and throttle can thus oscillate significantly. We observed this during a recent test flight.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2565608/42387985-53c6343e-8144-11e8-86d2-a42aecc4c5c0.png)


Log file from SITL where this can be seen: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=f18c45ab-622e-4b1d-9819-03cfb06af2b5 . Here, after t=3:20 the true altitude setpoint is still the same as before t=2:20 (i.e. 630m AMSL) but the FOH logic just wrongly sets it to 660m and adds slight oscillations on top. The exact amount of oscillations depends on waypoint distance, altitude difference etc, but i have seen altitude ref oscillations of up to 30m, resulting in full pitch up/down of the aircraft.

**Analysis**
See the commit for the location of the code where this is happening. Essentially, every time that the loiter radius of any loiter WP is larger than the acceptance radius calculated from the L1 turn distance, then the Navigator FOH would _not_ consider the waypoint reached and would thus not stop modifying the current altitude setpoint. This leads to the oscillations or offsets in the altitude reference. 

**Solution**
If in any loiter mode, consider the loiter radius times a factor of 1.2 (same as for the waypoint_reached logic [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L217) as the acceptance radius. Tested in SITL, which should be sufficient for this case.

@acfloria @ryanjAA @antiheavy FYI

												<td>2 hard faults (on ground + in air) with PX4FW v1.7.4</td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/9348</td>
												<td>## Bug Report
We (ASL/ETHZ) have recently had two hard faults that caused Pixhawk to reboot. One of them unfortunately happened in air with a 3.2m wingspan fixed-wing, one happened during on-ground testing.

## Setup
 - Hardware: mRo Pixhawk (px4fmu-v3 / 2MB flash)
 - Firmware: Basically PX4FW v1.7.4, i.e. master-branch from 5 days ago (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/71170dce0a87ce06e00d721a713dfc3dc92dfc11) but with some slight modifications mainly to adapt the mixers to our platform and one custom sensor driver. The estimator is EKF2, the flight controller is the stock controller.

## Hard fault 1: In-air
We had done 3 short MANUAL flights before that, and in this flight first flew manual for about three minutes and then switched to stabilized. The hard fault ocured 1 minute after switching to stabilized mode. The pilot continued to fly in PX4IO's (important!) manual override mode, and, as he barely noticed the issues, actually went back into stabilized mode for some time before then landing the plane following our instructions. The ulogger-log of part 1 (see below) stops in air. We could not find any fancy stuff in the logs before the log stops. Pixhawk rebooted in-air, and continued logging as usual (part2, see below).

- Log files (with attached hard fault log) from take-off to in-air hardfault and pixhawk reboot: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=3b702655-6052-46e6-85e2-fd012d27c25f
- Log file after the crash (i.e. after the pixhawk reboot until landing): https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=409fcb62-50ca-42d1-82c7-f1bcaccfe9fd
- Telemetry logs:[2018-04-20 15-13-09.log](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934640/2018-04-20.15-13-09.log) (rename to .tlog!). The reboot happens after ca 1/3 of the log file length, you can see that it happened because the relative altitude is suddently zero or even negative.

## Hard fault 2: On-ground
This happened during in-lab testing. We performed extensive pre-flight checks, including rebooting FMU (by pressing the reset button) and checking that IO's manual override still works. It did, but (and i assume this is normal because there is already a mixer present) loading the mixer after that provoked reboot fails. We let the plane then just sit there for a couple of minutes, and suddenly Pixhawk rebooted. This was a hard fault, too. We unfortunately assumed this was BECAUSE we had provoked the in-air restart via pushing the FMU reset button (and after testing for another 8 hours in-lab without any hard fault assumed everything was OK). I don't have the ulog-files yet, but i have:

- The hardfault log from the SD card (it looks very similar to the one we saw in flight): 
[fault_2000_01_01_18_53_35.log](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934634/fault_2000_01_01_18_53_35.log)
- The console output. Note again that this log starts after we provoked an FMU reset via pushing its reset button, that's why it is an in-air restart. 
[consoleLog.txt](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/1934645/consoleLog.txt)

I might be able to provide the firmware .elf file to allow debugging the hard fault as described in https://dev.px4.io/en/debug/gdb_debugging.html#debugging-hard-faults-in-nuttx if required.

I guess it makes sense to add this to https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/9271 @RomanBapst @LorenzMeier ?</td>

Flight mode changed successfully, the copter was armed and when I've applied throttle, it took off, but was completely uncontrollable with regards to roll and pitch.

Strangely, if you set EKF2_AID_MASK to 1 (GPS only) and have no GPS fix, you can still take off in modes, that don't need GPS fix (altitude control, stabilized) and everything works as intended.

I've expected the copter either to arm and fly normally or at least refuse to arm.

												<td>EKF2 Ekf::initialiseFilter() problem (disable mag, enable HGT_MODE Vision) </td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8761</td>
												<td>Hello.

Ekf::initialiseFilter() has some limitations:

// check to see if we have enough measurements and return false if not
bool hgt_count_fail = _hgt_counter <= 2 * _obs_buffer_length;
Here it doesn't take into account that user may choose HGT_MODE VISION but aircraft is sitting on the ground with camera giving vision only in air. So if there is no vision while we are on the ground then filter init fails.

bool mag_count_fail = _mag_counter <= 2 * _obs_buffer_length;
Here it doesn't take into account that mag may be disabled by user (CAL_MAG0_EN or CAL_MAG1_EN ). So if user disable mag manually then filter init fails.

bool ev_count_fail = ((_params.fusion_mode & MASK_USE_EVPOS) || (_params.fusion_mode & MASK_USE_EVYAW)) && (_ev_counter <= 2 * _obs_buffer_length);
Here it doesn't take into account that aircraft is sitting on the ground with camera giving vision only in air. So if there is no vision while we are on the ground then filter init fails.

Overall, if user choose AID_MASK 24 (vision position and vision yaw only) and do no provide vision data from the start to correctly initialise filter then it fails. But providing vision data when aircraft is sitting on the ground may not be possible in many cases.

if (hgt_count_fail || mag_count_fail || ev_count_fail) {
    return false;
}
 
Flight Log: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=7dacafb7-cd48-4296-a4c7-03c62a174c41

Expected behaviour:
1. If user disables mag manually then mag_count_fail must account it correctly depending on CAL_MAG0_EN or CAL_MAG1_EN params.
2. If user choose vision only mode or choose HGT_MODE vision and do not provide vision data while ekf2 is inited then filter must able to init itself without this data.

For the short-term hack it is possible just to setup all three variables to false (mag_count_fail, hgt_count_fail, ev_count_fail), but this solution is quite ugly.

**Repro**
1) Run [AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim), with PX4 connected, either SITL or HITL mode.
2) Run this python script 

```python
from AirSimClient import *

client = MultirotorClient()
client.confirmConnection()
client.enableApiControl(True)

client.armDisarm(True)

landed = client.getLandedState()

    client.takeoff()
        
time.sleep(2)

print("landing...")
client.land()

print("disarming.")

```

Notice client.land() times out because the extended sys state is stuck in MAV_LANDED_STATE_LANDING, and never reaches MAV_LANDED_STATE_ON_GROUND.  This seems to be a regression in v1.7.0, older versions of the firmware worked fine.</td>

												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/8263</td>
												<td>**Bug Report**

I file this as a bug report since I'm concerned that my crash today may have other reasons than accidentally flipping the Kill Switch. 

I was performing some tests to eliminate a strong Oszillation when braking in PosCTL. This was improving, when I wanted to do another Test, shortly after Taking of the Rotors stopped in Mid-Air and the Vehicle crashed on the road where Motors where spinning again. While hitting the Ground the Battery got disconnected (as can be seen in the Telemetry log). 

Sadly the ULG stops shortly after start so about 2meters of flight are missing from the Vehicles Log (this is kind of strange). Also the OSD did not record anything since it claimed that there was no Communication (this may also be a bug of the OSD FW but it said that there was no data for more than 400 secs, which usually does not happen). 

So I'm stuck with the Telemetry Log. This is the last I got over Telemetry (from the Log):

![killswitch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6877067/32623752-760951f8-c587-11e7-8ec7-9ea27c5a3fcf.jpg)

Here comes the 2nd strange Part. The Kill-Switch was engaged and disengaged under **0.5 sec and this twice in sequence**. I checked with my Remote and it is almost impossible to really push the switch to the position in-between where it may flip back in this quick manner. I'm not aware that I flipped the Switch and the Telemetry RC Input (Channel 6) does not reflect any change in Signal. I performed many flights, and never flipped the switch unintentionally.

												<td>mc_pos_control: fix position setpoint overshoot</td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/8240</td>
												<td>This PR addresses massive position setpoint overshoot caused by `_vel_sp_prev` windup. The bug is critical for offboard mode usage.

Flying in offboard mode we had constantly observed position setpoint overshoots in case of flight to distant setpoint. E.g., here we are flying back and forth in offboard mode: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=61a675f6-020a-462f-b1cf-b58974460d44. Overshoots really stand out:

![Overshoots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32437968-ff23a816-c2f9-11e7-8745-67fef6ea073d.png)

Here is plot of y, vy and corresponding setpoints for 1000 m flight in offboard in SITL on current master (https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=92b7ba3c-e2f7-4094-98a3-05e8b5a8493f):

![master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20798956/32437865-b5007b24-c2f9-11e7-9580-2f456f57f81b.png)

As can be seen on the plot, copter have overshooted setpoint for over 60 m because velocity setpoint started to drop from max forward velocity when copter already was 50 m ahead of setpoint.

After debugging of mc_pos_control_main.cpp it became clear that cause of overshoots is windup of `_vel_sp_prev(0)` and `(1)`. The reason is [this fragment](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/aa699cf4b7e63d9bf17dc2ba2b95e2e02224a6ab/src/modules/mc_pos_control/mc_pos_control_main.cpp#L2455) of `calculate_velocity_setpoint()`: 

```c++
if (!_control_mode.flag_control_auto_enabled) {
	vel_sp_slewrate(dt);
}

_vel_sp_prev = _vel_sp;

/* ... */

/* make sure velocity setpoint is constrained in all directions (xyz) */
float vel_norm_xy = sqrtf(_vel_sp(0) * _vel_sp(0) + _vel_sp(1) * _vel_sp(1));

if (vel_norm_xy > _vel_max_xy) {
	_vel_sp(0) = _vel_sp(0) * _vel_max_xy / vel_norm_xy;
	_vel_sp(1) = _vel_sp(1) * _vel_max_xy / vel_norm_xy;
}
```
So `vel_sp_slewrate()` never see constrained velocity and `_vel_sp_prev` continues to rise to hunders and thousands m/s. When copter approaches the setpoint, `_vel_sp_prev` drops, but it's change rate is limited by `vel_sp_slewrate()`. Because of this windup `_vel_sp` can't begin to lower at time and vehicle overshoots. Overshoots are negligible in AUTO mode because mc_pos_control moves position setpoint so it is always close to the vehicle.

It would be more correct to address this moving `_vel_sp_prev = _vel_sp` to the end of control cycle, but this change causes incorrect behavior of smooth takeoff limiter so I had to move velocity constraining before `_vel_sp_prev` assignment, leaving smooth takeoff limit after it.

This is the same 1000 m flight in SITL after fix (https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=d5bd2519-432c-446a-b8c9-fd021c2fdab6):

												<td>PX4 1.6.3: Strange problem with Airspeed-less transition.</td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/7545</td>
												<td>We were flying 1.6.3 for some time. But recently decided to reset all the parameters with the new defaults. For this we use change of air-frame procedure. So we carefully introduced our PIDs on top of the new defaults. We removed the circuit breaker for the airspeed and thus it did not ask us to calibrate the airspeed so the diff press cal params were empty 0.00. 

In this setup we were not able to complete the transition. It never stopped the quad despite the speed got exceeding 20 m/s and the transition continued forever up to the crash.

http://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=b6653ab1-ada7-4711-abaf-00a6a51249dc

Because we flew the 1.6.3 airspeed-less without a problem we just started thinking. We enabled the airspeed. Calibrated the airpseed. Then again we disconnected it from the breaker.

On the Bench test perfect transitions.

http://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=3647be91-b6f2-4be1-a5a3-f66ca93c8b94

Also we flew without airspeed without any problem. So the only thing we had to do was to calibrate the airspeed in order to make the transition in aispeed-less config.

During this tests we discovered another thing. In airspeed-less mode the only way we could manage the transition is timing. 

There is a parameter VT_F_TR_OL_TM which is supposed to guarantee fixed transition time without airspeed. But in reality in airspeed-less mode the transition is done now by the VT_TRANS_MIN_TM which is the minimum front transition time. The VT_F_TR_OL_TM did not have any effect over the transition timing.</td>

After a few consecutive reboots on the pixhawk, I obtained the following sequence:
The behavior was the following: `first calibration` -> `-9.8` -> `reboot` -> `-15` -> `2nd calibration` -> `-9.8` -> `reboot` -> `-3` -> `3rd calibration` -> `-9.8` -> `reboot` -> `-15` -> `reboot` -> `*-9.8*` -> `reboot` -> `-15` -> `reboot` -> `-15` - `reboot 3x` -> `-9.8` -> `reboot` -> `-15` .........

I tried with two other new PixHawks Pro v3.1 and I can reproduce the error. However, strange thing, I tried on a v1.2 and I wasn't able to obtain the same result after more than 10 consecutive reboots.

Few days ago I flown my multicopter for about 1.5 km. and almost got flyaway, only using RC saved it for safe landing. 
I got 'ALL DAT LINK LOSS' and it seems that RTL has been engaged (I still had downlink). but, instead of flying toward home position for landing the multicopter started to fly very fast backward.
from the log I see that just after losing the datalink (at 10:28) it did got new heading, X and Y setpoints of home. but just after that (when the link was regained?) the position setpoint sets back to its current position, no change of heading setpoint. and the multicopter gets higher and higher pitch, that leads it to fly very fast backward, not closing the X and Y position setpoints. I have tried to send new commands reposition, pause the multicopter seems to be affected by them but still contiues to fly at very high speed.
At this point (2km away) we toke RC control, and fly it to home for landing.

												<td>Hello,

We made a mission without RC control only with the QGC. We used version 3.1.3. Everithing went ok except the land detector did not disarm after the mission was complete and the VTOL was landed. The only way we could disarm with 3.1.3 was emergency stop.

VTOL left on the ground with spinning motors for some time.

Here is the log:

Also in Position or Altitude modes we have the same problem. The land detector probably is working, because when we touch down in one of Alt and Pos Modes the QGC says we have to be either in manual mode or landed in order to disarm.

I saw it is very easy in QGC 3.2 to disarm. But it is still very nice if in the case of mission and Guided modes after touch down the land detector could at least disarm in 10-20 seconds.</td>

When enabling actuator setpoints for offboard mode, the simulation progresses in a much slower speed than normal simulations. This seems to be caused by actuator controls published in offboard module interfering with lockstep.

This bug was discovered by @MarvinHarms 

## To Reproduce
- Publish `offboard_control_mode` message with actuator controls enabled (internally from PX4)
- Publish `actuator_controls_o` message when in offboard mode
- switch vehicle to offboard mode

## Expected behavior
Lockstep should continue whether or not the vehicle is in offboard mode

														<td>**Describe problem solved by this pull request**
We use offboard mode to control our quadrotor.
We generate a trajectory in z position with consistent derivatives.
When we land, our z position increase downward, z speed converge to our target (1m/s downward) and our z acceleration converges to 0 when the speed stabilizes.

The issue is that when we hit the ground, land detector detect it but the position control detect that we want to takeoff so thrust increase and it never disarm.

The takeoff detection is due to our z acceleration been about 0 but with a very small oscillation that makes point upward  by moments.

Here is a log with one false detection : https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=ced2541e-fd20-4fd3-88c6-2f284262bc95

**Describe your solution**
in offboard mode, if we have a valid z position setpoint superior (so more downward) than estimated, do not consider we want to take off. Same thing on z speed.

This solution will change the behavior: in offboard mode, if we have a valid z position setpoint more downward than estimated and a speed setpoint pointing upward, we will no longer consider we want to take off.</td>

1.11.3 - Fixed Wing

After some debate on this I decided to open an issue.

Navigation between waypoints is not consistent and does not follow the expected direction (more detail below). The direction is circuitous.



In the first log, it was clear there was some mag interference (this was seen on the ground prior to takeoff - approximately 10 degrees could not be corrected even after multiple calibrations) but the issue was that the trajectory from one waypoint to the next does not make sense (in parts of the flight). Instead of going from one point to the next, there are large turns between them.

I questioned if this was due to an insufficient SD card speed for reading the mission. Testing the SD card speed in QGC gave an average speed of 63kb/s (much too slow but this was only changed after these flights) and there are logging dropouts at some of the points in the log. Right around 22 min where the location looks to be sideways, it was not. In the telemetry replay it does a coordinated turn. This turn at least makes sense, that is the direction is was supposed to go. That changes though later in the same flight.

At 22:46 it looks like the aircraft starts to circle down. Maybe to hit the altitude set-point but that does not make too much sense seems it looks like it doesnt actually miss it. After it does circle down though it then just decides to go left (no errors still) and then circle around again. Mag issue? There is no reason for a turn to be in that direction though. The question becomes is if this is mag related and or SD card read access speed and mission related.

The below log had a new mag installed and there weren't any offsets observed or mag ratios, etc but at 13:17 instead of turning left, the aircraft made a roll to the right before banking to the left to turn. Additionally, it went directly through the waypoint before turning instead of starting at the L1 distance and making the typical rounded turn. From 13:18-13:25 the log looks like the aircraft is going to the wrong direction but there is also a log dropout there, in the telemetry log the orientation and direction looks correct in terms of how the aircraft flew but not why it still turned so late and went right then left.

														<td>**Describe the bug**

there's a sudden drop in the pitch setpoint just after the back transition of the standard vtol in the master. i think the initial setpoint after the back transition is set to zero  just after the back-transition, i just looked at the value of _v_att_sp.pitch_body in the vtol_att_control_main.cpp file in case mode:ROTARY_WING

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
you can load this plan and reproduce the same with standard_vtol
[plan.zip](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/files/5765173/plan.zip)

**Expected behavior**
pitch setpoint should not drop immediately just after the transition, it should come down gradually.

														<td>when using just the vtol-transition mission item in qgc, or flipping the switch from fw to mc mode stabilized mode, the curved path gets executed with a rolling behavior in the back transition

this is solved in the pr-vtol-rtl-fixes when using vtol transition and land mode, but however it still persists on the above mentioned conditions as the l1 controller is present in those two conditions in the back-transition.

**Alternate Solution**
https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/d502292d0731a38c513dc1224c135b6f1965586e/src/modules/vtol_att_control/standard.cpp#L283
in the current master, _fw_virtual_att_sp->roll_body diverges from zero after some time in the back-transition, can we make it a hard zero as we don't want the aircraft to roll in the back-transition anyway?

**To Reproduce**
to reproduce, in a mission set a vtol-transition mission item at the end of the mission. the behavior can be observed.


**Expected behavior**
The vtol should transition to mc_mode in a straight line without going in a curved path with a roll.

https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14405/files
this introduced l1 controller to be present in the back transition which is good, but i think it needs to be further analyzed, cause this causes the aircraft roll in the back transition, which is not desirable.

														<td>[VTOL] Broken Weathervane & broken MPC_YAW_MODE</td>
														<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15673</td><td>**Describe the bug**
The weather vane does not work anymore in Mission (MC mode). Neither does MPC_YAW_MODE have an effect on the heading. So the drone ends up flying in all directions with the same heading, which is ugly to watch and can be dangerous in high winds. 

**To Reproduce**

Tested in SITL on v1.11.0:
1. Launch Gazebo with `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol__windy` (by default 4m/s wind from South to North)
2. Execute some mission which contains navigation in MC mode (e.g. [Dummy_MC_loop.zip](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/files/5162328/Dummy_MC_loop.zip))
3. Observe the heading.



**Expected behavior**
As stated in the docs (https://docs.px4.io/master/en/config_vtol/vtol_weathervane.html#mission-mode-behaviour). The drone should head into the wind. Also, MPC_YAW_MODE should behave as for a normal MC. I'm open to discussion whether the weather vane should have precedence over the heading calculations of MPC_YAW_MODE or not or if both should be active at the same time and you end up with a compromise. But certainly not changing the heading at all is not good.

**Log Files and Screenshots**
 https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=41546a93-eaeb-45c8-af75-fcfd2af6b967 : always heading east, neither weathervaning nor heading towards waypoint.

S500 with Pixhawk 4 and Drotek Sirius RTK GNSS (with RM3100 magnetometer).
Pixhawk 4 with rotation_roll 180
GPS no rotation

Installed master firmware to Pixhawk 4, the vehicle couldn't arm due to compasses inconsistent pre-arm check error, this error is not cleared even after compass calibration. Pixhawk 4 and GPS (with external compass) are facing forward, but the error says they are inconsistent. Installed previous commits until I found the issue was introduced by commit e819f99, before this commit I'm not getting this error.

Compass calibration can be performed without issue, but this will not clear the pre-arm error.

Compass calibration was performed outdoors and indoors with the same result.

Checked with the GPS (with compass) included with Pixhawk 4 and is working, so this is issue is with the Drotek Sirius RTK GNSS device. 

**To Reproduce**
1. Use Pixhawk 4 + Drotek Sirius RTK GNNS
2. Install commit  e819f99 or a newer commit.
3. Try to arm
4. See compasses inconsistent error
5. Calibrate compass
6. Try to arm
7. See error

**Expected behavior**
Vehicle should be able to arm since compasses are facing same orientation.

													<td>Altitude Losses and Gains: Possible Barometer Issues</td>
													<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/15096</td>
													<td>**Description:**
PX4 struggles to hold altitude using the barometer in both the AltHold and PosHold flight modes. Cross-breezes result in altitude gains/losses. Maneuvers result in altitude loss. Typically, the more rapid the maneuver the larger the altitude loss.

**To Reproduce:**

_Method 1_
1. Drone switched into position hold and armed after a 3D-lock is obtained.
2. Take off to an altitude far beyond the ground-effect zone.
3. Pick an axis to evaluate (eg. positive x-axis)
4. Perform a full-stick maneuver along that axis until max horizontal speed is achieved.
5. Release the sticks
6. Altitude is lost near the end of the position change and during the braking maneuver. For these maneuvers the altitude returns to the set-point after 2-5sec (far too long).
[Maneuver Altitude Loss]( https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=4972dc44-0636-4abc-a065-dbc4c23d32f5)

_Method 2_
1. Drone switched into position hold and armed after a 3D-lock is obtained.
2. Take off to an altitude far beyond the ground-effect zone.
3. Release sticks (no RC input). 
4. Wait for a cross-breeze
5. Altitude raises or lowers (multiple meters). During these tests the drone very slowly (10-25sec), if ever, returns to the setpoint. 
[Wind Altitude Gain/Loss](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=511f8756-384c-4a3d-b214-4f9a8f401b58)

**Expected Behavior:**
In AltHold and in PosHold, if the z-setpoint is not changed, the craft will not change altitude.   

**Screenshots:**

![Forward Dip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66424788/84535991-eb4fee00-acba-11ea-9d09-45d2a5344f4c.png)
Caption: Note the bulge in the barometer altitude coupled with the decrease in thrust both of which result in a dip during and after maneuvers.

_Method 2_
![Wind Altitude Gain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66424788/84535994-ebe88480-acba-11ea-8888-dcaf1bbf9951.png)
Caption: Note the three bulges in velocity and the area between the actual and desired curves. NO RC commands or values were given between 2:40 and the 3:25 time-stamps. After 3:25, the drone started to gain many meters of altitude at which point a downward RC command is given. Even though almost full-stick down is commanded, the copter continued to rise until the breeze (2-5mph) settled. 

**Craft Specifications:**
The craft itself runs 18x5.5in props on a 900mm frame and uses a Holybro Pixhawk 4 running PX4. The craft is rather heavy but well within the motors and batteries specifications for thrust and power available/required respectively.
Firmware version v1.10.1 was used for all initial testing. Firmware version v1.11.0-beta2was used to connect external barometers through the I2C port (ex. for BMP388) because this is not provisioned for in v1.10.1.
These same performance issues are also present and reproducible on a much lighter craft (15x5.5 props, 750mm frame, Pixhawk 4, v1.10.1).

**Attempted Solutions:**
1)	The first tests were performed using the stock on-board MS5611 barometer with no shielding. The flight performance was fine but produced noticeable dips upon maneuvering in any direction. 
2)	The issue  https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/10058 suggested shielding the barometer, and adjusting the EKF2_BARO_NSE, EKF2_PCOEF_%%%, EKF2_BCOEF_%%%, and EKF2_DRAG NOISE parameters. Shielding the barometer in an indirectly ported enclosure did not produce noticeable differences. (in either data or performance). Adding open-cell foam around the PX4 inside the enclosure also did not produce noticeable differences. Moving the barometer very far away from the propellers did not produce noticeable differences.
3)	After shielding and isolation were tested and had no effect on the problem, the suggested parameters began to be changed but shielding with enclosure and foam was kept for the remaining test. Setting the XN, XP, YN, and YP EKF2_PCOEFs to their minimum value of -.5 very slightly reduced the dip (10-30cm out of 1-3m). 
4)	After PCOEFs were ineffectual, the BCOEFs were next to be altered. A theoretical ballistic coefficient was calculated for this aircraft using the drag coefficient of a flat-plate, the mass of the aircraft, and the area of the central plate. The calculated value was 23.96kg/m^2 (1kg/m^2 lower than default). The ballistic coefficient parameter was altered from minimum to maximum values. The EFK2_drag.innovations[0:1] were examined after each flight but did not change in RMS value. EKF2 Replay was attempted using JMavSim on a Windows 10 machine but errors were thrown upon completion of the documentation steps and replay never worked. Changing BCOEFs had little to no effect on the EKF2 innovations for both drag and wind estimation.
5)	The last of the suggested parameters was EKF2_BARO_NSE. Raising EKF2_BARO_NSE to a value of 5m improved flight performance and reduced dips while maneuvering. This is NOT a solution to the problem as all it does is transition estimation authority from to the barometer to the GPS. The entire intent of this testing is to have consistent altitude performance even without GPS assistance (to fly in buildings and structures) therefore this is not the most desirable solution.
6)	After the above parameters failed to solve the problem, the EKF2_HGT_MODE was changed from barometer to GPS. This stopped the dip from occurring but once again is not a solution. After GPS was used, a downward-facing LIDAR was used with range-aid enabled without it being the primary height sensor and with range-aid and as the primary height sensor. Both of these removed the dip while maneuvering and followed terrain well. These too are undesired solutions due to limited LIDAR range and the possibility of ground-based objects messing up the LIDAR altitude estimation.
7)	The next series of testing began with an external barometer/GPS from Zubax enabled via UAVCAN. This also featured the MS5611 chip and yielded the same results as the on-board MS5611 for all of the above tests. This GPS was also enclosed in the Zubax designed enclosure with open cell foam in the barometer enclosure (inside the overall enclosure). With UAVCAN enabled, both the external barometer and the external GPS were used as the primary GPS and barometer but did not produce noticeable differences in flight performance.
8)	No other types of barometers were supported in v1.10.1 so v1.11.0-beta2 was used for the rest of the testing. The v1.11.0-beta2 code was altered to enable the driver for the BMP388 acquired from Adafruit. The MS5611 driver was also disabled to ensure that the BMP388 would be used for pressure-height data and not the on-board sensor. The PIDs for the rate, attitude, and XY- position controllers were able to be tuned to achieve the desired performance. The Z-position/velocity controller gains were left at default. Hover flight could be achieved as expected however, when a breeze blew the craft would gain altitude and not settle back to the set-point. The second log of the 3-4min flight is the best example of this. No control input would be given and the craft would gain altitude at the maximum allowed vertical speed (2m/s, default = 3m/s). The P and I values of the controller were reduced to close-to or just above the minimum allowed values (to create a sluggish and under-tuned controller) and still the craft would ascend at maximum vertical speed in a slight cross-breeze (2-5mph). For the end of the flight, the rise in altitude was partially counteracted by a downward RC command but almost full-stick down was commanded before the aircraft consistently began to descend.

**Notes:**  
I hypothesize that both flight abnormalities are caused by the pressure changes across the barometer. That being said, all tested barometers were a fully enclosed as they could have been without rendering them inoperable. My second hypothesis is that the altitude fusion in the EKF2 does not handle these barometer fluctuations well. The same craft flown with a DJI A3 controller does not have these problems when flown under the same conditions (wind, maneuvers, poor GPS environment, etc.). These logs and descriptions hopefully show problems with dynamic pressure handling (either craft moving in static air or air moving over static craft) that Pixhawk 4 has. This problem effects AltHold, PosHold, and Loiter flight modes and mission performance in many different scenarios and its significant diminishment or removal would make PX4 based systems more useful and versatile.

													<td>Drone flies towards old mission waypoint on arm, when no current=1 is set on new mission</td>
													<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14981</td>
													<td>**Describe the bug**
When a mission is stopped midway, and the drone then lands, receives a new mission with all items having ``current=0`` parameters and is armed again, the drone immediately flies towards the waypoint from the old mission, instead of executing the first item on the new mission. This crashed our drone as it tilts and tries to fly forward before properly "takeoff" to a safe altitude, thus catching the ground with the landing struts.  

The resetting of ``mission_current`` seems to happen upon arming, but there seems to be some sort of race-condition, as the drone reports ``mission_current`` to reset to 0 upon arming, but the log shows the drone still gets a setpoint for the old waypoint and tries to fly that, before the ``mission_current`` index reset is realised.

Thomas Stauber spotted that our velocity controller asked for a 3m/s horizontal velocity immediately upon arming, which indicated that the drone was flying towards an old mission item.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7889925/82942796-d4aa5700-9f98-11ea-85f8-13f5744f75a6.png) 

**To Reproduce**
Steps we did to reproduce the behaviour:
1. Fly normal mission
2. Before normal mission finishes, switch mode to "land now" or "RTL" and land the drone
3. Start new flight with identical mission. (It uploads the same mission again, but doesn't clear the old one first)
4. Arm and send "start_mission" command
5. Drone attempts to fly to the waypoint it was at in the last mission and thus flip in the direction of that waypoint.

**Expected behavior**
Upon uploading a new mission with no ``current=1`` parameters set, we would expect the drone to reset the current-index of mission items to 0. Intuitively I would expect the index to get reset when the PX4 accepts the new mission and sends ``MAV_MISSION_ACCEPTED`` and not first on arming the drone.

													<td>Takeoff denied in HITL Simulation with Gazebo</td>
													<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14721</td>
													<td>**Describe the bug**
When running a HITL setup with Gazebo, I can arm (the rotors in Gazebo start spinning) but I cannot takeoff. QGC's error message is only "Takeoff command temporarily rejected". In the log it says "Critical: Takeoff denied! Please disarm and retry". Doing so leads to the same result.
A SITL setup with Gazebo works fine. Using JMavSim in a HITL setup works perfectly, too.
One difference I have noticed when comparing my error scenario to the two that work: QGC says the value of Alt (Rel) is NaN (or --.-- on the HUD).

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install the development toolchain according to the [Toolchain Installation](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/setup/dev_env.html).
2. Follow the [instructions for setting up a HITL simulation](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/simulation/hitl.html) with Gazebo.
    a) In step 4 of the Simulation Setup for Gazebo I use `/dev/tty.usbmodem01` on my MacBook Pro. On an iMac I've had to use `/dev/tty.usbmodem1`.
    b) In a recent commit the iris world was removed, so instead of running Gazebo as in step 5 of the Gazebo Setup section, I've had to run `make px4_sitl gazebo` again to achieve the same result. I have already had the described problem before this change was made.
3. After starting QGC in step 6 of the instructions for the Gazebo Setup, arm the drone and select Takeoff in QGC.

**Expected behavior**
The drone should takeoff without errors and I should be able to see that it does so in the Gazebo client.

												<td>Failsafe for position loss in Offboard mode</td>
												<td>https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/14076</td>
												<td>**Describe the bug**
When a position loss event occurs while in Offboard mode (which requires a valid position estimate), the vehicle performs a blind land failsafe, despite the fact that COM_POSCTL_NAVL is configured to "Assume R/C, switch to altitude mode..." and there is a remote control.

**To Reproduce**
Stream VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE mavlink messages to simulated Iris copter (in Gazebo), switch to offboard and fly to a waypoint (via SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED message). While the drone is flying to the waypoint, stop sending VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE messages.

**Expected behavior**
I would have expected that the failsafe obeys the COM_POSCTL_NAVL parameter and switches to Altitude mode (hight estimation was valid due to barometer). I also tried the same thing in Position mode and there it actually does switch to Altitude mode as expected.

												<td>Large negative Pitch Setpoint at takeoff, hand launched Fixed Wing</td>

												<td>Most of our fixed wing flight logs show a large negative step input to the pitch command right at Takeoff.  I think the "minimum pitch" param in the Takeoff Waypoint overrides this, but behind the scenes something is wrong.

I've seen users attempt to auto-takeoff to a non-Takeoff Waypoint and the vehicle immediately noses into the ground.

I suspect some bad interactions between LandDetector and typical ground handling of hand launched fixed wings, but I'm not sure what exactly...  (fyi @dagar we discussed previously).

Here are a number of logs that show this issue right at Takeoff:
